# Speaker-Identification-from-dialogue-scripts
Part of NLP project, In which we developed methods to identify characters based on their dialogues using Machine Learning

USC CSCI 544 Project **Text Based Speaker Identification on Domain Specific Conversation Corpus**

The datasets scraped, cleaned and used are:
* Friends - 10 seasons - top 6 characters
* The Big Bang Theory - 10 seasons - top 5 characters

The raw datasets, and the scripts to scrape and clean them are present in the *Data Collection* folder.

The cleaned (from *Data Collection* scripts) and pre-processed datasets (from *Data Analysis* scripts) are in the *Datasets* folder.

The data analysis (and preprocessing) scripts are in the *Data Analysis* folder.

The baseline and bert based models are in *ML Models/Baseline Models* and *ML Models/BERT* folders. These folders also contain various csv files and confusion matrix images. As the models were too large, they have not been uploaded.

The f1 scores and inference script are in *Inference* folder.

The final report has been uploaded as well in the root folder - *NLP_Final_Report.pdf*.
