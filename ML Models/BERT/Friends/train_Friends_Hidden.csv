2389,No.,RACHEL,PHOEBE
2390,"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I...

Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",JOEY,RACHEL
