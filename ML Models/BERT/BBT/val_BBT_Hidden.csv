293,"Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.",OTHERS,SHELDON
294,"Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.",PENNY,SHELDON
295,Leonard.,PENNY,SHELDON
296,"Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.",OTHERS,SHELDON
297,Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?,OTHERS,SHELDON
298,Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?,OTHERS,SHELDON
299,I don’t believe it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
300,Let’s go.,HOWARD,OTHERS
301,Like am I dressed okay?,HOWARD,PENNY

306,What is this?,HOWARD,LEONARD
307,Sheldon!,LEONARD,LEONARD
308,My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.,LEONARD,HOWARD
309,"I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her.",HOWARD,HOWARD
310,Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?,RAJ,LEONARD
311,So it does bother you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
312,"Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.",LEONARD,PENNY
313,"Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.",SHELDON,SHELDON
314,"Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.",LEONARD,PENNY
315,"But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?",RAJ,RAJ
316,My mother is so gonna love her.,HOWARD,HOWARD
317,A good question.,SHELDON,SHELDON
318,I’m not hungry.,RAJ,SHELDON
319,"I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.",LEONARD,OTHERS
320,Can we please talk about anything else?,RAJ,LEONARD
321,"Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie’s purse.",HOWARD,HOWARD
322,"So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.",SHELDON,SHELDON
323,"Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.",LEONARD,PENNY
324,"Hang on, there’s got to be other options.",HOWARD,LEONARD
325,"Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.",PENNY,HOWARD
326,"Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.",SHELDON,SHELDON
327,Just breaking in your new car.,SHELDON,LEONARD
328,So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?,LEONARD,LEONARD
329,"Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.",SHELDON,SHELDON
330,Here you go.,LEONARD,LEONARD
331,They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.,HOWARD,LEONARD

333,"I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.",SHELDON,OTHERS

357,"Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.",RAJ,LEONARD
358,There’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.,HOWARD,LEONARD
359,"A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.",SHELDON,SHELDON
360,Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
361,"I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job today.",OTHERS,LEONARD
362,They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.,OTHERS,SHELDON
363,You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?,PENNY,PENNY
364,"All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?",HOWARD,PENNY
365,"Uh, gift? Uh, Present!",OTHERS,SHELDON

367,"Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?",LEONARD,PENNY
368,"It’s pajamas, there’s no cape.",HOWARD,LEONARD
369,Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?,LEONARD,HOWARD
370,We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
371,What the hell are bus pants?,LEONARD,PENNY
372,Where exactly did your mother have you tested?,LEONARD,SHELDON
373,Is that your card?,HOWARD,SHELDON
374,When are you gonna tell Emily?,HOWARD,RAJ
375,"Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.",SHELDON,SHELDON
376,"Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.",OTHERS,SHELDON
377,I turn into a bear?,PENNY,SHELDON
378,Do what?,HOWARD,LEONARD
379,"I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS
380,"While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?",HOWARD,HOWARD
381,"I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a vote. Oh, and also…",LEONARD,LEONARD
382,Stealing is against the law!,SHELDON,SHELDON
383,"Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.",SHELDON,SHELDON
384,You okay?,LEONARD,PENNY
385,"Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.",SHELDON,PENNY
386,"Yeah, it’s just one sneeze.  You’re on your own.",LEONARD,PENNY
387,"It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
388,Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
389,What’s wrong?,LEONARD,LEONARD
390,Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.,HOWARD,RAJ
391,"For Howie’s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?",OTHERS,OTHERS
392,"I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.",SHELDON,PENNY
393,"Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
394,"Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order.",SHELDON,SHELDON
395,I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.,SHELDON,SHELDON
396,"Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?",SHELDON,SHELDON
397,Yeah. Do you?,HOWARD,LEONARD
398,"Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.",RAJ,LEONARD
399,Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?,LEONARD,PENNY
400,Is my coitus whimsically inventive?,LEONARD,SHELDON
401,"Well, hello? She’s married.",PENNY,SHELDON
402,"Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me.",RAJ,SHELDON
403,Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.,LEONARD,PENNY
404,"Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.",SHELDON,SHELDON
405,What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.,SHELDON,HOWARD
406,"You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.",OTHERS,SHELDON
407,"Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move.",OTHERS,LEONARD
408,"Again, I’m right here.",LEONARD,LEONARD
409,Could you be a little more specific?,PENNY,SHELDON
410,So?,HOWARD,LEONARD
411,"Well then, bed mister.",LEONARD,SHELDON
412,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
413,"Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.",PENNY,HOWARD
414,It was for haemorrhoid cream.,PENNY,SHELDON
415,I need another drink.,OTHERS,SHELDON
416,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
417,"Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.",OTHERS,SHELDON
418,I thought I heard something.,LEONARD,SHELDON
419,Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?,SHELDON,SHELDON
420,How?,OTHERS,LEONARD
421,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
422,Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?,SHELDON,RAJ
423,"Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.",OTHERS,OTHERS
424,"Well, the night is still young.",PENNY,LEONARD
425,I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.,SHELDON,OTHERS
426,"You’re welcome, Penny.",SHELDON,SHELDON
427,"Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.",RAJ,RAJ
428,Are you okay?,OTHERS,PENNY
429,Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?,SHELDON,PENNY
430,"Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.",PENNY,PENNY
431,I don’t know. How do you want to start?,RAJ,LEONARD
432,"Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?",OTHERS,SHELDON
433,"Well, did you see this sticker?",SHELDON,SHELDON
434,"No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.",SHELDON,SHELDON
435,I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?,PENNY,PENNY
436,I am.,HOWARD,SHELDON
437,You proposed to Penny?,HOWARD,SHELDON
438,"Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.",OTHERS,PENNY
439,Sure.,OTHERS,LEONARD
440,A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle.,HOWARD,HOWARD

443,She does have a short attention span.,SHELDON,SHELDON
444,Penny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
445,Son of a bitch.,HOWARD,HOWARD
446,"I understand it, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
447,"Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.",OTHERS,HOWARD
448,Uh.,OTHERS,LEONARD
449,I’m coming!,LEONARD,SHELDON
450,He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.,OTHERS,HOWARD
451,Just tell me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
452,What? Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
453,"Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.",OTHERS,SHELDON
454,Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.,PENNY,LEONARD
455,"So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?",PENNY,PENNY
456,You can be Aquaman.,LEONARD,RAJ
457,"Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive.",SHELDON,SHELDON
458,"Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.",HOWARD,PENNY
459,"Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.",LEONARD,LEONARD
460,See? We both think so.,SHELDON,SHELDON
461,Okay. I have a request to make.,RAJ,SHELDON
462,Are you ill?,SHELDON,SHELDON
463,You do?,SHELDON,LEONARD
464,"Oh, come on, give her a chance.",HOWARD,LEONARD
465,See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.,OTHERS,PENNY
466,"Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.",RAJ,PENNY
467,"Okay. So, what do you need?",PENNY,PENNY
468,"Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
469,"Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine.",PENNY,PENNY
470,"Yeah, it’s all real exciting.",OTHERS,PENNY
471,You may want to leave the room.,RAJ,SHELDON
472,"What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.",RAJ,HOWARD
473,"Sheldon, that isn’t necessary.",OTHERS,LEONARD
474,Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.,SHELDON,SHELDON
475,"Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.",PENNY,PENNY
476,"Oh, sure, what’s up?",LEONARD,PENNY
477,That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.,LEONARD,SHELDON
478,That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.,SHELDON,SHELDON
479,Shut up. I solved it.,PENNY,HOWARD
480,The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.,SHELDON,SHELDON
481,"I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.",SHELDON,SHELDON
482,"No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now.",PENNY,PENNY
483,"Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.",OTHERS,SHELDON
484,"Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.",SHELDON,SHELDON
485,"If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
486,"Oh, God, you’re kidding.",OTHERS,PENNY
487,"No, I was just visiting a friend.",OTHERS,LEONARD
488,"Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.",SHELDON,SHELDON
489,Oh. I want this.,OTHERS,LEONARD
490,"I don’t have a few minutes, I’m running really late.",PENNY,LEONARD
491,It is remarkable.,SHELDON,SHELDON
492,"To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.",OTHERS,SHELDON
493,Thank you.,PENNY,SHELDON
494,"Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?",SHELDON,SHELDON
495,"I was giving clear, concise orders.",SHELDON,SHELDON
496,You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.,OTHERS,LEONARD
497,What are you doing?,LEONARD,SHELDON
498,It’s open.,PENNY,LEONARD
499,Not funny.,OTHERS,LEONARD
500,"Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.",HOWARD,HOWARD
501,Sheldon?,HOWARD,LEONARD
502,"All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?",OTHERS,SHELDON
503,"Well, what’s wrong with that?",PENNY,PENNY
504,Get them down.,PENNY,LEONARD
505,"Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?",RAJ,LEONARD
506,"That isn’t Klingon, it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.",RAJ,SHELDON
507,I really thought he was gonna say let it go.,PENNY,LEONARD
508,I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.,HOWARD,SHELDON
509,What? Why?,RAJ,LEONARD
510,He rejected train day.,SHELDON,SHELDON
511,Who’s running the red Corvette?,LEONARD,HOWARD
512,He’s hanging in there.,RAJ,LEONARD
513,"Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?",LEONARD,SHELDON
514,I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.,LEONARD,RAJ
515,"Okay, stop, stop!",PENNY,PENNY
516,I said I’m sorry.,HOWARD,SHELDON
517,Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?,PENNY,SHELDON
518,"Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.",SHELDON,SHELDON
519,It’s gonna get crazy.,LEONARD,LEONARD
520,"Oh, Beverly. How nice.",OTHERS,PENNY
521,"Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.",PENNY,PENNY
522,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD

524,"Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.",OTHERS,RAJ
525,Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
526,We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.,LEONARD,RAJ
527,Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?,OTHERS,LEONARD
528,I really did think you looked pretty.,SHELDON,OTHERS
529,"Penny, you are on fire.",LEONARD,SHELDON
530,"Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.",LEONARD,LEONARD
531,"Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.",RAJ,PENNY
532,We were worried about you.,PENNY,LEONARD
533,"And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him.",LEONARD,HOWARD
534,There was a draft.,LEONARD,LEONARD
535,Public access enabled.,HOWARD,SHELDON
536,"Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.",PENNY,PENNY
537,"Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.",LEONARD,HOWARD
538,"You’re still gonna go, right?",OTHERS,LEONARD
539,Great. Did we say a time?,LEONARD,LEONARD
540,"Gee, thanks a lot.",LEONARD,PENNY
541,"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit.",SHELDON,SHELDON
542,"What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?",RAJ,PENNY
543,Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
544,"All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.",SHELDON,SHELDON
545,Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?,OTHERS,PENNY
546,See? She’s good with it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
547,What’s going on?,RAJ,LEONARD
548,We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.,LEONARD,SHELDON
549,"Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps.",LEONARD,LEONARD
550,He could’ve softened the blow.,SHELDON,SHELDON
551,"Let me guess, you want it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
552,"Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.",PENNY,PENNY
553,"You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
554,Great.,HOWARD,LEONARD
555,"No, no, Stan Lee.",LEONARD,HOWARD
556,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
557,"I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?",PENNY,LEONARD
558,I may have overreacted.,OTHERS,SHELDON
559,"Hey, buddy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
560,Mm-hmm. And?,LEONARD,PENNY
561,"No, that’s not fair either.",SHELDON,LEONARD
562,Welcome.,RAJ,SHELDON
563,Sheldon.,OTHERS,LEONARD
564,"Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?",PENNY,RAJ
565,"Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.",LEONARD,SHELDON
566,Please?,OTHERS,SHELDON
567,Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.,LEONARD,LEONARD
568,Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.,LEONARD,LEONARD
569,"Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.",SHELDON,SHELDON
570,"Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him.",PENNY,PENNY
571,"Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.",OTHERS,SHELDON
572,"Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.",SHELDON,HOWARD
573,Say yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
574,"And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.",SHELDON,SHELDON
575,Coming!,LEONARD,SHELDON
576,"Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.",LEONARD,LEONARD
577,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
578,There are post-prom mating rituals?,SHELDON,SHELDON
579,Shut up.,PENNY,LEONARD
580,"All right, that’s enough jail talk.",OTHERS,PENNY
581,"Well, who would ever guess that?",SHELDON,PENNY
582,It actually says at least?,SHELDON,LEONARD
583,"Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.",LEONARD,SHELDON
584,"Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.",SHELDON,SHELDON
585,That’s a negatory. But there’s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.,HOWARD,SHELDON
586,"So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
587,"Don’t worry, you’ll thank me.  Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali.  Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe.  You may now thank me.",HOWARD,RAJ
588,Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.,LEONARD,HOWARD
589,"Well, I didn’t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off.",OTHERS,RAJ
590,"Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.",LEONARD,HOWARD
591,"No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.",OTHERS,SHELDON
592,"Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it.",HOWARD,RAJ
593,Alright.,LEONARD,SHELDON
594,"It does, doesn’t it?",OTHERS,LEONARD
595,"Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me.",SHELDON,PENNY

601,Okay.,RAJ,PENNY

624,I have to take notes?,PENNY,SHELDON
625,Your big problem is me telling her.,RAJ,LEONARD
626,"Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.",RAJ,RAJ

646,You could have told her the truth.,SHELDON,LEONARD
647,"And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.",HOWARD,RAJ
648,So?,RAJ,LEONARD
649,What’s wrong?,SHELDON,LEONARD
650,"I can make it, but I won’t.",SHELDON,SHELDON

654,"Alicia is an actress, just like you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
655,Pushover.,RAJ,OTHERS
656,I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.,SHELDON,SHELDON

658,"Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you.",OTHERS,OTHERS
659,Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?,HOWARD,SHELDON
660,Oh?,OTHERS,SHELDON
661,Amy.,PENNY,SHELDON

664,He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.,PENNY,LEONARD

689,Yeah. I think I’m gonna take her to miniature golf.,HOWARD,HOWARD
690,"Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button.",HOWARD,SHELDON
691,I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
692,"Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
693,Hi.,PENNY,PENNY

702,Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.,HOWARD,LEONARD

704,I noticed you never answered me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
705,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
706,I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.,PENNY,OTHERS

724,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
725,"Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…",RAJ,LEONARD
726,This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.,LEONARD,SHELDON
727,Nope.,PENNY,LEONARD
728,You’re boring people sweetie.,PENNY,PENNY
729,"Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.",HOWARD,PENNY
730,"Oh, pish-posh.  I don’t know, it means shucks.  Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.",HOWARD,SHELDON
731,Get out!,SHELDON,LEONARD
732,"You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.",LEONARD,LEONARD
733,"Thanks a lot, Howard.",LEONARD,LEONARD
734,I think you’re the one who fell over.,LEONARD,LEONARD
735,How are you saying that with a straight face?,HOWARD,SHELDON
736,"Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya.",LEONARD,HOWARD
737,Good thinking.,OTHERS,SHELDON
738,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.,PENNY,PENNY
739,It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.,RAJ,SHELDON
740,Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.,OTHERS,SHELDON
741,That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.,SHELDON,SHELDON
742,Sure.,OTHERS,LEONARD
743,What is that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
744,You did what you had to do.,RAJ,LEONARD
745,What are you talking about?,LEONARD,LEONARD
746,"Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.",HOWARD,PENNY
747,"Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?",SHELDON,SHELDON
748,I’m so glad you understand.,OTHERS,OTHERS
749,"Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.",OTHERS,SHELDON
750,"It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.",RAJ,PENNY
751,"Hang on, why do we have to hate it?",LEONARD,LEONARD
752,It’s not a problem.,HOWARD,LEONARD
753,"Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.",LEONARD,RAJ
754,"Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.",PENNY,PENNY
755,I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
756,I don’t know.,PENNY,PENNY
757,It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.,HOWARD,SHELDON
758,"If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
759,I don’t follow.,SHELDON,SHELDON
760,"Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.",SHELDON,SHELDON
761,"Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on.",HOWARD,HOWARD
762,"Okay, let’s see if this drug works.",RAJ,PENNY
763,"Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
764,"All right. Uh, what’s new with you?",LEONARD,PENNY
765,"That’s me. Bye, Stuart.",SHELDON,SHELDON
766,"Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?",PENNY,LEONARD
767,"Here, this will help.",PENNY,LEONARD
768,"Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?",LEONARD,PENNY
769,"Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.",HOWARD,HOWARD
770,Sometimes people say things they don’t mean.,HOWARD,LEONARD
771,"Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.",SHELDON,SHELDON
772,"Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.",SHELDON,SHELDON
773,"W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?",PENNY,LEONARD
774,You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.,LEONARD,SHELDON
775,Aw…,SHELDON,PENNY
776,"Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.",OTHERS,SHELDON
777,But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.,LEONARD,SHELDON
778,Who’s Frank and Alicia?,LEONARD,SHELDON
779,"In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?",SHELDON,SHELDON
780,"Okay, I’m out.",HOWARD,PENNY
781,"You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.",PENNY,LEONARD
782,That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.,RAJ,LEONARD
783,"No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.",PENNY,HOWARD
784,"You don’t have to, you should want to.",RAJ,LEONARD
785,"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines.",SHELDON,SHELDON
786,You mean like Spock?,SHELDON,LEONARD
787,There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve.,SHELDON,LEONARD
788,You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?,OTHERS,SHELDON
789,Unbelievable.,LEONARD,PENNY
790,Do you want me to hold that computer?,OTHERS,SHELDON
791,And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.,OTHERS,HOWARD

797,It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it.,LEONARD,PENNY
798,How about boys versus girls?,PENNY,LEONARD
799,"Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.",LEONARD,HOWARD
800,You want some wine?,PENNY,PENNY
801,"Sheldon, come on.",OTHERS,LEONARD
802,No.,SHELDON,LEONARD
803,"Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.",LEONARD,SHELDON
804,"Okay. Thank you, you’re the best. Mm.",PENNY,PENNY
805,"But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.",SHELDON,HOWARD
806,"Well, get it. Get it for me.",PENNY,PENNY
807,What?,SHELDON,LEONARD
808,How was I supposed to know that?,PENNY,LEONARD
809,"No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.",LEONARD,SHELDON
810,"Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.",SHELDON,SHELDON
811,"Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.",PENNY,RAJ
812,"Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep.",PENNY,PENNY
813,What did you do?,PENNY,SHELDON
814,"Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?",SHELDON,SHELDON
815,Whoa. Where did that come from?,HOWARD,PENNY
816,"Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.",RAJ,RAJ
817,"That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
818,"This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.",OTHERS,SHELDON

820,Not now!,OTHERS,LEONARD
821,"Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.",OTHERS,SHELDON

836,"God, they’re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?",OTHERS,OTHERS
837,Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?,LEONARD,SHELDON

849,Hello. How’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?,SHELDON,SHELDON
850,I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool.,OTHERS,SHELDON
851,"Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see, who’s left? Oh, that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?",LEONARD,SHELDON

873,Really?,HOWARD,LEONARD
874,"Good-bye, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON

876,"If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?",LEONARD,LEONARD
877,"Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.",SHELDON,SHELDON
878,"When you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. How’d you get by?",OTHERS,LEONARD

911,You that desperate?,HOWARD,LEONARD
912,"If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.",RAJ,SHELDON
913,"No offence, Stuart, but the woman’s a doctor.",LEONARD,SHELDON
914,"It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?",OTHERS,HOWARD
915,Thanks.,HOWARD,OTHERS
916,Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
917,"I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.",PENNY,OTHERS

919,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
920,Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.,HOWARD,LEONARD

922,"Eh, what can you do?",HOWARD,SHELDON
923,"Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.",HOWARD,HOWARD
924,It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.,LEONARD,SHELDON
925,Yes,LEONARD,LEONARD
926,Will you please tell me where we’re going?,OTHERS,SHELDON
927,Hi.,OTHERS,PENNY
928,"Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.",PENNY,PENNY

930,What just happened?,RAJ,LEONARD
931,"I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.",SHELDON,RAJ
932,"Not in a rush, busy with work…",PENNY,LEONARD
933,"I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.",LEONARD,SHELDON

965,I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.,RAJ,RAJ
966,"Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?",SHELDON,SHELDON
967,"Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
968,Just tell me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
969,"Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.",SHELDON,SHELDON
970,I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?,PENNY,LEONARD
971,That’s because we are.,LEONARD,LEONARD

977,"I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.",SHELDON,SHELDON

980,Open the mail!,SHELDON,SHELDON

987,"Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
988,I’m gonna fix this right now.,OTHERS,HOWARD

990,"Oh, that’s nothing.",PENNY,PENNY
991,"I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?",SHELDON,SHELDON

997,Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
998,"With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?",RAJ,LEONARD
999,"Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.",SHELDON,SHELDON

1038,"Listen to her, Jim.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1039,"Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.",RAJ,SHELDON

1139,"Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?",PENNY,PENNY
1140,Brent Spiner?,SHELDON,LEONARD

1180,"Hey, everybody, listen up.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1181,"It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening.",SHELDON,SHELDON

1213,"Well, a little. You hear stuff.",PENNY,PENNY
1214,Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.,LEONARD,RAJ
1215,"Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls’ night tonight.",OTHERS,RAJ
1216,"This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.",RAJ,LEONARD

1467,"Oh, hey.",PENNY,LEONARD
1468,What?,RAJ,LEONARD
1469,What about this one?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1470,Not to blow on a miniature time machine.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1471,"That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1472,There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1473,One was already in an accident.,PENNY,SHELDON
1474,"Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1475,They found the remote controlled cars.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1476,That’s a good question.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1477,A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.,SHELDON,SHELDON

1490,I feel awful.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1491,"Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.",HOWARD,RAJ
1492,"Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says, “well, I’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”",PENNY,SHELDON
1493,"I didn’t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I’d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.",OTHERS,PENNY
1494,There you go.,LEONARD,LEONARD

1500,New shirts?,PENNY,LEONARD
1501,What are we doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD

1505,The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?,SHELDON,HOWARD

1507,"Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day.",PENNY,PENNY
1508,Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1509,Well just a feeling.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1510,Not that kind of confused.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1511,"Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1512,"There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?",SHELDON,SHELDON

1518,That sounds mean.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1519,Good night.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1520,Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1521,Really?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1522,"Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…",PENNY,PENNY
1523,In your apartment.,PENNY,SHELDON
1524,"It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.",RAJ,SHELDON
1525,What do you think?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1526,That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.,LEONARD,PENNY
1527,Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?,OTHERS,RAJ

1544,"Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1545,"There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.",LEONARD,PENNY
1546,You got the wrong mustard.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1547,"Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.",RAJ,SHELDON
1548,Because you were being selfish.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1549,"Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1550,Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1551,"Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1552,"Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don’t tell me, I want to be surprised.",RAJ,SHELDON
1553,So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1554,"Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.",LEONARD,PENNY
1555,"Ah, good, Penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1556,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1557,In this context for me could mean with me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1558,"You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.",RAJ,OTHERS
1559,"I care. Oh, wait, no, I don’t. Good luck, Raj.",PENNY,LEONARD
1560,He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.,LEONARD,LEONARD

1565,It’s so hard to say no to you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1566,"Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1567,"Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?",HOWARD,SHELDON
1568,"Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1569,"Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend.",LEONARD,OTHERS
1570,"Oh, right.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1571,"Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?",LEONARD,PENNY
1572,"What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1573,I have to talk to her about this.,RAJ,LEONARD

1578,"Oh, we really need to get you a girl.",LEONARD,PENNY
1579,"Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.",PENNY,PENNY
1580,Clowder.,SHELDON,SHELDON

1582,Thanks. And I taste good too.,SHELDON,OTHERS
1583,"Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1584,Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1585,"Yeah, it’s pretty great.",RAJ,PENNY
1586,"No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1587,"No, it’s not.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1588,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.,SHELDON,RAJ
1589,"She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1590,"Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room.",RAJ,LEONARD
1591,"If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening.",RAJ,LEONARD
1592,"Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1593,"Me, too.",HOWARD,OTHERS
1594,"You mean, kiss you now?",LEONARD,PENNY
1595,"Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.",SHELDON,RAJ
1596,"So, where do we want to hang it?",LEONARD,PENNY
1597,That’s the spirit.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1598,"We are, that’s why I’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless.",HOWARD,PENNY
1599,"You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.",PENNY,PENNY
1600,22.,PENNY,SHELDON
1601,Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1602,"Okay, it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action.",PENNY,PENNY
1603,Maybe your tongue is shrinking.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1604,"Okay, well, wish me luck.",OTHERS,PENNY
1605,"Yeah, I know.",LEONARD,PENNY
1606,Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.,SHELDON,SHELDON

1611,Why?,RAJ,LEONARD
1612,"All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.",HOWARD,PENNY
1613,"I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1614,It really is.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1615,"Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1616,"No, I didn’t do it for the money.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1617,Marty and Doc never had have had brought?,SHELDON,HOWARD
1618,You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?,PENNY,OTHERS
1619,"Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1620,"It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house.",HOWARD,PENNY
1621,"I repeat, not gonna happen.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1622,Is that a pregnancy test?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1623,"It’s six o’ clock, I have to get back to Raj’s before he wakes up and realises I’m gone.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1624,R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1625,"Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1626,She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1627,You do?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1628,"Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1629,I’m not moody. I’m fun.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1630,We’d have to go to every Party City in California.,LEONARD,RAJ
1631,"Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1632,"Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1633,"Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?",LEONARD,HOWARD
1634,Here we go.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1635,No more than Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1636,"Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.",RAJ,SHELDON
1637,"Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.",PENNY,LEONARD
1638,When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.,SHELDON,RAJ
1639,Sorry I’m late.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1640,Are you done?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1641,Do you have any ideas?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1642,"That is the worst, isn’t it?",PENNY,LEONARD
1643,Make it two.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1644,I was going to see that with him.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1645,"Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth.",LEONARD,OTHERS
1646,It smelled too much like blue jay.,HOWARD,RAJ
1647,Here we go. Fifteen?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1648,"You’re right, I’m the problem, I’m the one that needs help.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1649,"Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?",PENNY,SHELDON
1650,Ready whenever you guys are.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1651,"Oh, how kind of her.",LEONARD,PENNY
1652,I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.,PENNY,PENNY
1653,"Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1654,I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1655,"Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.",PENNY,SHELDON
1656,"Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1657,"Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.",RAJ,SHELDON
1658,I can’t date Amy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1659,"Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.",RAJ,PENNY
1660,"But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?",RAJ,PENNY
1661,"Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1662,Okay.,SHELDON,PENNY
1663,Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?,PENNY,RAJ
1664,"Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1665,"All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1666,"Hey.  Oh, no.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1667,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1668,"Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1669,"Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?",OTHERS,LEONARD
1670,No. I really give up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1671,"Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?",PENNY,PENNY
1672,"Headaches, dizziness and nausea.",PENNY,SHELDON

1674,"Ooh, like what?",OTHERS,PENNY
1675,Bye guys.,PENNY,LEONARD
1676,"Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.",PENNY,PENNY
1677,"At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?",OTHERS,SHELDON
1678,Here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1679,"But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?",RAJ,PENNY
1680,Yeah. I would not have done that for you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1681,"All right. So, what’s new in your life?",PENNY,PENNY
1682,Like who?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1683,"Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1684,I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?,PENNY,PENNY
1685,Who’s there?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1686,"It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.",RAJ,RAJ
1687,That was close.,HOWARD,LEONARD

1689,He struck out.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1690,"So, is the wedding still on?",HOWARD,PENNY
1691,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1692,Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1693,Want to go to Vegas this weekend?,PENNY,LEONARD
1694,"All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.",LEONARD,PENNY
1695,"It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1696,"Oh, Leonard, what time is it?",PENNY,SHELDON
1697,"Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.",SHELDON,SHELDON

1701,We broke up weeks ago.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1702,This place is really beautiful.,PENNY,OTHERS
1703,Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1704,That is not true. All I did was build a robot.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1705,"Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?",PENNY,PENNY
1706,It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.,SHELDON,SHELDON

1711,"Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1712,"Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1713,"Oh, I like that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1714,When did I have pistachios?,PENNY,SHELDON
1715,Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.,RAJ,RAJ

1721,With what?,RAJ,LEONARD
1722,My mirth. Classic.,PENNY,SHELDON
1723,Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1724,"Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.",OTHERS,PENNY
1725,"Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.",RAJ,PENNY
1726,"Gee, Sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually on the other side of the tie.",PENNY,PENNY
1727,That’s stupid. Why?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1728,"Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.",LEONARD,PENNY
1729,"Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke.",OTHERS,PENNY

1737,"Penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1738,"Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1739,"Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.",RAJ,RAJ

1743,"According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.",OTHERS,SHELDON

1745,Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1746,"Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1747,Okay.,HOWARD,PENNY
1748,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1749,"No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1750,You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1751,Here we are.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1752,"Well, not now.",RAJ,SHELDON
1753,When did that happen?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1754,"Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1755,"Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.",OTHERS,PENNY
1756,I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1757,Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1758,Come in.,SHELDON,OTHERS
1759,It’s true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1760,Please leave me out of this.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1761,Be cool.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1762,"Sheldon, what did you do?",PENNY,PENNY
1763,"Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.",PENNY,PENNY
1764,Don’t ask me. A little elf did it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1765,I could have made her very happy.,RAJ,LEONARD
1766,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1767,Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1768,You’re welcome.  I’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1769,"Put up or shut up. You make it, I’ll drink it.",RAJ,SHELDON
1770,"No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1771,"You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?",LEONARD,RAJ
1772,Evidently.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1773,Isn’t that great?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1774,"Get it together, man.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1775,I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1776,"Doesn’t matter, does it?",SHELDON,LEONARD
1777,"Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.",PENNY,SHELDON
1778,I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1779,I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1780,"Relax, it’s just a dirty sock.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1781,"Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him.",OTHERS,PENNY
1782,"I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1783,Just…. a lot.,PENNY,LEONARD
1784,No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1785,You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1786,"Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better.",PENNY,SHELDON
1787,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1788,"Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1789,Everything is stupid and I want to go home.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1790,"Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1791,"C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1792,I say we investigate.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1793,It came from Tiffany’s.,LEONARD,RAJ
1794,I am not going to fold.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1795,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1796,"But, uh, what, what about Amy?",OTHERS,PENNY
1797,Grossman.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1798,Three months. This is gonna be great!,SHELDON,LEONARD
1799,"Stop it, Ma. I’m sure I can get Bernie to come around.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1800,Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1801,How is that a new invention?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1802,"I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1803,"Oh, someone’s been shopping at Gucci.",PENNY,PENNY
1804,"All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing.",PENNY,PENNY
1805,And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1806,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.,RAJ,LEONARD
1807,We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1808,Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?,HOWARD,HOWARD
1809,What’s this?,HOWARD,PENNY
1810,"Me, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1811,But I thought I’d be more excited.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1812,I’m never gonna talk to her again.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1813,"Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1814,"Well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1815,Fine. I want to release butterflies.,PENNY,SHELDON
1816,Oh. What’s going on?,OTHERS,PENNY
1817,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
1818,"You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?",PENNY,PENNY
1819,"Or the one. Dammit, I’ll do it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1820,Really? Do we do that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1821,Interesting.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1822,Do boys have flowers?,PENNY,OTHERS
1823,"Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.",LEONARD,RAJ
1824,"With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1825,"Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.",RAJ,PENNY
1826,"Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1827,Okay.,OTHERS,PENNY
1828,It tastes the same.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1829,So?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1830,The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1831,"Yeah, sure, that might be fun.",LEONARD,PENNY
1832,"Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.",PENNY,RAJ
1833,"Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1834,What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1835,"Stay, I’ll get her.",RAJ,LEONARD
1836,"Yeah, more cutbacks.",LEONARD,HOWARD
1837,"I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?",LEONARD,RAJ
1838,I was working with Dave Underhill.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1839,"Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.",LEONARD,HOWARD
1840,"I’m fine, thanks for asking. I’ve come to call on Missy.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1841,But we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1842,"Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1843,"Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1844,"Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?",OTHERS,PENNY
1845,"Sheldon, we have to go.",PENNY,LEONARD
1846,"No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person.",OTHERS,PENNY
1847,Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?,RAJ,SHELDON
1848,Play through the pain.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1849,"Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.",PENNY,HOWARD
1850,"Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1851,"Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1852,"Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1853,I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1854,Corolla!,HOWARD,SHELDON
1855,"Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1856,"No, Stuart, don’t.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1857,"Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.",PENNY,PENNY
1858,"Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed.",RAJ,LEONARD
1859,"Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.",PENNY,PENNY
1860,"Yes, I will go out with you.",PENNY,LEONARD
1861,"Oh, oh, here we go.",PENNY,PENNY
1862,"Yeah, that must get old quick.",LEONARD,PENNY
1863,Let’s try just walking out.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1864,What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1865,"I appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, I’m swooping in on her like a vulture.",RAJ,HOWARD
1866,"Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1867,"Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1868,I’ll be back.,PENNY,SHELDON
1869,Can you believe how pushy she is?,RAJ,OTHERS
1870,Since when?,RAJ,LEONARD
1871,Howard built a sex robot.,RAJ,LEONARD
1872,Nothing with quarks.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1873,That’s nice.,HOWARD,OTHERS
1874,"Okay, but that’s just a theory. It’s not even a complete thought.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1875,I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.,RAJ,RAJ
1876,"Sorry, I forgot.",PENNY,LEONARD
1877,How is that building on what he just said?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1878,Uh-huh. We’re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.,OTHERS,RAJ
1879,"Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…",HOWARD,SHELDON
1880,"You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1881,"Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1882,The flower dies.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1883,"Alright you guys, good luck.",PENNY,LEONARD
1884,"Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.",PENNY,PENNY
1885,"Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.",LEONARD,RAJ
1886,how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1887,"Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.",PENNY,PENNY
1888,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1889,"Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.",PENNY,PENNY
1890,"Hey, how did it go?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1891,"Sure. ‘sup, homes?",HOWARD,LEONARD
1892,"Well, then you know her better than I do.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1893,Yummy. And warm on my back.,SHELDON,RAJ
1894,If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can’t take it out of bathroom time.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1895,"Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1896,"Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.",PENNY,PENNY
1897,"Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1898,Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?,OTHERS,SHELDON
1899,Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1900,Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?,SHELDON,PENNY
1901,"All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  Oh, my God. What is with you guys?",PENNY,PENNY
1902,It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?,PENNY,SHELDON
1903,"And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.",SHELDON,RAJ
1904,"Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1905,"So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1906,"Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?",LEONARD,PENNY
1907,See what?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1908,"Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1909,"Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1910,I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.,PENNY,OTHERS
1911,You don’t think that will be awkward?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1912,"Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1913,"Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?",HOWARD,LEONARD
1914,"It’s not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.",RAJ,RAJ
1915,"Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…",LEONARD,HOWARD
1916,"Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life.",PENNY,SHELDON
1917,"Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?",PENNY,PENNY
1918,"Oh, you’re my little homunculus.",PENNY,SHELDON
1919,"Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.",PENNY,LEONARD
1920,I thought you left a long time ago.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1921,Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1922,Your arch enemy?,PENNY,SHELDON
1923,You didn’t?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1924,"I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m tall and I’m doing it.  Ah, man.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1925,"Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.",LEONARD,RAJ
1926,"Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1927,"‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1928,"Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.",PENNY,RAJ
1929,Absolutely.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1930,"How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1931,I’m sorry. I did what I could.,RAJ,LEONARD
1932,What is happening?,PENNY,LEONARD
1933,"Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1934,It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1935,It’s not important.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1936,What does it look like?,SHELDON,OTHERS
1937,"No, I do not. You are a mean little man.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1938,"Yeah, I think I would.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1939,I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1940,A hobby?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1941,"Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1942,"Oh, this day just keeps getting better.",SHELDON,PENNY
1943,"Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years.",RAJ,RAJ
1944,You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.,PENNY,OTHERS
1945,For how…,SHELDON,SHELDON
1946,"Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.",PENNY,SHELDON
1947,Yeah. You know her?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1948,"How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!",PENNY,PENNY
1949,"Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1950,"How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?",OTHERS,OTHERS
1951,"You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?",OTHERS,HOWARD
1952,What invitation?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1953,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1954,"It’s hard to say, my life would be so different.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1955,"Hey, you know what this could mean.",HOWARD,PENNY
1956,And the wave is gone.,PENNY,SHELDON
1957,"You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1958,"Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.",PENNY,LEONARD
1959,"Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.",PENNY,PENNY
1960,"Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.",LEONARD,HOWARD
1961,"I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!",PENNY,LEONARD
1962,How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1963,"Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1964,"Okay, well, you know, it’s just me. I’m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.",PENNY,PENNY
1965,"You’re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.",RAJ,SHELDON
1966,Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1967,"Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1968,I don’t know where we went wrong.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1969,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1970,Armin who?,SHELDON,HOWARD
1971,"Me, too.",PENNY,OTHERS
1972,"Really, your potty training journal?",PENNY,LEONARD
1973,Go online and look it up.,RAJ,LEONARD
1974,Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1975,That’s great.,PENNY,LEONARD
1976,"He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON
1977,It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1978,No. We cannot lose to that jerk.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1979,"‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1980,Wow.,SHELDON,PENNY
1981,I know. You think people are gonna be mad?,LEONARD,PENNY
1982,"You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1983,"Okay, have fun.",LEONARD,PENNY
1984,Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1985,"I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1986,"Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1987,Feel like driving to Arizona with me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
1988,That sounds nice.,PENNY,OTHERS
1989,Really? You love them?,LEONARD,PENNY
1990,It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1991,"Well, he’s seen me without pants on.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1992,Agreed.,PENNY,SHELDON
1993,"I know it’s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1994,What do you mean?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1995,"You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1996,You weren’t there. He was really flirting.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1997,"Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn’t really understand it but…",PENNY,PENNY
1998,"Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.",PENNY,PENNY
1999,Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.,RAJ,PENNY
2000,Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2001,Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.,RAJ,SHELDON
2002,"All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2003,"There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2004,"Oh, yeah, I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging.",PENNY,PENNY
2005,"Yep, one sec.  Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.",HOWARD,HOWARD
2006,I’m so proud of you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
2007,"Congratulations, you got it last.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2008,I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.,LEONARD,PENNY
2009,"Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.",SHELDON,RAJ
2010,To you?,PENNY,SHELDON
2011,"My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2012,Come on. She’s not that bad.,PENNY,LEONARD
2013,"Okay, yeah.",PENNY,PENNY
2014,"You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin.",HOWARD,PENNY
2015,"Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.",HOWARD,HOWARD
2016,"Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2017,I can name tons.,PENNY,HOWARD
2018,And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?,SHELDON,RAJ
2019,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2020,I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.,LEONARD,SHELDON

2022,What a jerk.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2023,‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?,LEONARD,RAJ
2024,"Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.",OTHERS,PENNY
2025,"All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.",LEONARD,PENNY

2037,I don’t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2038,I’m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He’s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2039,"Yeah, well, I know that now.",SHELDON,PENNY
2040,Who just had sex with me at work.,LEONARD,LEONARD

2042,"I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.",PENNY,SHELDON
2043,Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2044,No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2045,"Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller.",OTHERS,RAJ

2053,Sheldon?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2054,"What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2055,"That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply.",RAJ,SHELDON

2092,Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?,SHELDON,SHELDON

2201,"Uh, it’s in the corner.",RAJ,LEONARD
2202,"Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?",RAJ,SHELDON

2223,What’s wrong?,PENNY,LEONARD
2224,"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2225,Mountain Elf.,SHELDON,SHELDON

2231,Always.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2232,"Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?",LEONARD,PENNY

2234,Get out.,LEONARD,LEONARD

2257,"Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour.

2258,"Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2259,Is it Eddie Crispo?,RAJ,HOWARD
2260,Okay.,HOWARD,PENNY

2265,And sometimes we marry them anyway.,PENNY,HOWARD
2266,That’s my French toast.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2267,‘sup?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2268,"Okay, that’s it, you’re fired.",LEONARD,PENNY
2269,Where are you going?,SHELDON,SHELDON

2271,"Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",PENNY,PENNY
2272,"I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.",PENNY,SHELDON
2273,"Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills.",PENNY,PENNY
2274,Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.,PENNY,HOWARD
2275,I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2276,"Well, those big kids were rocking it.",HOWARD,PENNY
2277,"No. Then you’ll get all sexed up and I’m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted.",HOWARD,PENNY

2291,"For me, it was a bonding moment.",RAJ,SHELDON
2292,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON

2296,"Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2297,"It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2298,Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2299,"Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.",RAJ,RAJ

2576,"I am fine. Here, eat your toast.  Sorry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2577,Chicken?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2578,"Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2579,"I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2580,"Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.",PENNY,PENNY
2581,"Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.",HOWARD,PENNY
2582,"You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.",LEONARD,RAJ
2583,We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2584,"And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2585,Exactly.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2586,No.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2587,"Oh, I can take a look at it.",SHELDON,PENNY
2588,"Yes, he is.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2589,Keep dreaming.,OTHERS,LEONARD

2595,"Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?",PENNY,PENNY
2596,You’re the reason I’m doing it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2597,Moo-stache.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2598,"You know, I’ve actually had one I’ve been sitting on for years.",HOWARD,PENNY
2599,"And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2600,"I buried it there, so we could go home.",RAJ,LEONARD
2601,Don’t look?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2602,"Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2603,"For science, maybe you should.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2604,It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2605,"Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.",RAJ,HOWARD
2606,What the heck is this?,RAJ,PENNY
2607,"That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2608,The what?,PENNY,LEONARD
2609,I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?,OTHERS,HOWARD
2610,I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.,RAJ,HOWARD
2611,It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.,LEONARD,RAJ
2612,Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.,SHELDON,PENNY
2613,"Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2614,And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2615,Wait. Is brought right?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2616,"Well, not really.",LEONARD,PENNY
2617,"No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2618,"Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?",PENNY,PENNY
2619,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2620,"Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2621,"I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2622,"Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?",OTHERS,PENNY
2623,Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2624,"Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.",LEONARD,PENNY
2625,Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2626,"Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2627,"So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2628,My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2629,So? He loves trains.,PENNY,SHELDON
2630,"Hi, Ma. How are you?",HOWARD,HOWARD
2631,What colour would you like to be?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2632,"Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up.",LEONARD,RAJ
2633,"All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?",PENNY,PENNY
2634,Right… I didn’t….,LEONARD,LEONARD
2635,"Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?",RAJ,SHELDON
2636,"Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.",RAJ,SHELDON
2637,Do you really think there’s reason to worry?,PENNY,LEONARD
2638,"Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2639,"Okay, I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I’m going in.",PENNY,SHELDON
2640,"Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2641,Answer it.,RAJ,SHELDON

2643,"Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.",HOWARD,PENNY
2644,"Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2645,"For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2646,"Well, it still doesn’t.",HOWARD,PENNY
2647,Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.,HOWARD,RAJ
2648,"You know, it’s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days.",PENNY,PENNY

2653,"Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.",RAJ,RAJ
2654,But she did dump you.,RAJ,LEONARD
2655,"Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it.",PENNY,SHELDON
2656,"Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2657,"You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2658,"That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2659,"Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2660,"Oh, my God.",PENNY,PENNY
2661,I didn’t have clams.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2662,Can you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2663,Is everything okay?,PENNY,PENNY
2664,"Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy.",PENNY,PENNY
2665,Why’s that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2666,"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2667,"If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2668,"Uh, yes, ma’am.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2669,It’s sad that you know that.,RAJ,LEONARD

2671,Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2672,Real cocoa?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2673,"Yeah, you do. You dog, you.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2674,I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.,HOWARD,OTHERS
2675,"Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.",PENNY,SHELDON
2676,I’d like you to meet my mother.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2677,That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2678,This should be fun.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2679,"Howard, here’s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.",PENNY,SHELDON
2680,"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2681,"Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy.",PENNY,RAJ
2682,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2683,"Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2684,"I feel so, so bad.",OTHERS,PENNY

2686,You didn’t have to do that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2687,"Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to.",PENNY,PENNY
2688,"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2689,Sheldon.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2690,"Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?",LEONARD,RAJ
2691,Come and get it.,RAJ,LEONARD
2692,"Oh, I miss her already.",RAJ,RAJ
2693,Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2694,"You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we’ll get free drinks.",PENNY,PENNY
2695,"Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend.",PENNY,PENNY
2696,"Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.",RAJ,HOWARD
2697,I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.,PENNY,SHELDON
2698,"You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?",RAJ,RAJ
2699,Not really. Can you come over?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2700,"Uh, that’s different. First of all, we’re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.",OTHERS,RAJ
2701,"We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?",HOWARD,HOWARD
2702,What happened?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2703,Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2704,It’s a Bernadette thing.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2705,Grab your hammer.,PENNY,HOWARD
2706,"Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance.",HOWARD,HOWARD
2707,I want that one.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2708,Are you going to the office?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2709,What are you complaining about? I’m the one who has to take the class again.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2710,I don’t understand.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2711,"Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.",RAJ,RAJ
2712,"Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.",RAJ,SHELDON
2713,I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2714,Where does he work?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2715,"No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?",OTHERS,HOWARD
2716,"Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on.",PENNY,PENNY
2717,Then you’re insane.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2718,Fine with me.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2719,"So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2720,"Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2721,"No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2722,"My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2723,I don’t want you to see me naked.,PENNY,SHELDON
2724,"Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2725,Say hi to Emily for us.,PENNY,RAJ
2726,Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2727,"A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now.",HOWARD,HOWARD
2728,"I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2729,Ask me to pass the soy sauce.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2730,You’re welcome.,PENNY,SHELDON
2731,"Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!",LEONARD,LEONARD
2732,"Be patient, we’ll get there.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2733,What do you want me to do?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2734,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2735,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
2736,"Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?",HOWARD,PENNY
2737,"Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2738,What are you doing?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2739,"It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2740,"They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…",LEONARD,RAJ
2741,Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2742,They’re bigger than mine.,LEONARD,OTHERS
2743,"Oh, are you still going to spend the night?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2744,"Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2745,"Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2746,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2747,"Oh, that is so… so…",SHELDON,PENNY
2748,Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2749,"Well, how much do you spend on food?",HOWARD,PENNY
2750,"Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story.",LEONARD,LEONARD

2753,"Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough.",LEONARD,PENNY
2754,I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.,OTHERS,RAJ
2755,Okay.,SHELDON,PENNY
2756,Because I’m afraid to know the answer.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2757,Gladly.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2758,We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.,RAJ,SHELDON
2759,"Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.",RAJ,PENNY
2760,"Yeah, sure.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2761,"That’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2762,She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.,RAJ,RAJ
2763,"Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.",PENNY,SHELDON
2764,"I’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it.",OTHERS,LEONARD

2766,"Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.",RAJ,SHELDON

2768,"Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2769,This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2770,Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2771,"No, it’s not.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2772,Yes. And would you make it diet?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2773,I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2774,Why are you still doing this?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2775,"You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2776,Hi.,OTHERS,PENNY
2777,"Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.",OTHERS,LEONARD

2779,"Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.",RAJ,RAJ
2780,Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2781,I do see what you’re saying. That helps.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2782,Got it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2783,"I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2784,What?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2785,I thought I smelled popcorn.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2786,"No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.",LEONARD,PENNY
2787,"But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass.",LEONARD,RAJ
2788,I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2789,"That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.  Well, that was a little uncalled for.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2790,"Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2791,"No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2792,"Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2793,The parade?,PENNY,SHELDON

2799,"Hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2800,"Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.",LEONARD,PENNY
2801,Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?,LEONARD,PENNY
2802,"I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.",LEONARD,LEONARD

2805,I’m regretting this already.,PENNY,LEONARD

2807,"Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2808,Hello.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2809,"Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2810,How could I not?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2811,Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2812,Freakishly feline?,OTHERS,RAJ
2813,Oh. Cool.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2814,"Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2815,Sex doesn’t count.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2816,"Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2817,So? We’re in a rock band.,HOWARD,PENNY
2818,Run.,PENNY,SHELDON
2819,"Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2820,That’s good. That’s good. That’s good.,PENNY,LEONARD
2821,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2822,"It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2823,"Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.",RAJ,RAJ
2824,Bye.,PENNY,LEONARD
2825,"Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.",PENNY,HOWARD

2831,"It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2832,Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.,SHELDON,PENNY
2833,That’ll be four seventy-five.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2834,"Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2835,"Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2836,"Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other.",SHELDON,HOWARD

2838,"Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2839,What recordings?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2840,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2841,Hi.,LEONARD,PENNY
2842,I wouldn’t.,SHELDON,LEONARD

2844,"Okay, good luck to you.",OTHERS,PENNY
2845,"Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.",PENNY,PENNY

2847,"Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2848,"Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2849,What is it?,PENNY,LEONARD
2850,"Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made.",SHELDON,SHELDON

2944,Let me help you.,OTHERS,SHELDON

2946,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
2947,Then 128.,OTHERS,SHELDON

2961,Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2962,This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.,SHELDON,SHELDON

2964,Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2965,Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.,RAJ,RAJ

2971,I’ll call ya.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2972,"I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.",SHELDON,SHELDON

3004,Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.,LEONARD,SHELDON

3006,"Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try",LEONARD,PENNY

3014,"Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat.  Oh, grow up, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON

3029,Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.,LEONARD,RAJ

3031,Then what’s with the disinfectant?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3032,"Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.",LEONARD,PENNY
3033,"Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3034,I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.,SHELDON,SHELDON

3038,That’s just Sheldon backwards.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3039,"It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3040,"Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?",SHELDON,PENNY

3423,"Yeah, go ahead.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3424,"Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.  Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.",LEONARD,LEONARD

3435,How did that work out?,RAJ,SHELDON
3436,"They’re coming to America, They’re coming to America.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3437,Comforting you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3438,"I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?",OTHERS,LEONARD
3439,"Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great.",LEONARD,RAJ
3440,"As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence.",SHELDON,SHELDON

3445,There you go.,PENNY,LEONARD
3446,"Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3447,You’re really okay with that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3448,Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?,SHELDON,RAJ
3449,"Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.",PENNY,PENNY

3484,Can we not play this game?,RAJ,SHELDON
3485,Strike two.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3486,And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.,PENNY,SHELDON
3487,"I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before.",SHELDON,SHELDON

3508,"Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3509,"Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.",RAJ,HOWARD
3510,"Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.",LEONARD,PENNY
3511,I love you.,HOWARD,OTHERS

3515,"Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.",RAJ,LEONARD
3516,"I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3517,"Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.",PENNY,PENNY
3518,"One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him.

3527,How?,PENNY,LEONARD
3528,That was for my cushion.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3529,"Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3530,I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3531,"Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?",HOWARD,HOWARD

3534,When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?,SHELDON,LEONARD

3548,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
3549,You don’t think I’m a leader?,HOWARD,SHELDON

3558,Does it spin around and do tricks?,LEONARD,HOWARD
3559,"Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3560,Coming.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3561,"Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman.",LEONARD,RAJ

3564,"Yeah, I think so.",LEONARD,LEONARD

3616,Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.,LEONARD,SHELDON

3618,"No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.",SHELDON,PENNY

3699,"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3700,M-hmm.,PENNY,LEONARD

3707,No you didn’t.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3708,"So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3709,"Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?",HOWARD,SHELDON
3710,"Well I’d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down..",RAJ,SHELDON
3711,"Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?",PENNY,SHELDON
3712,"Sheldon, what did you expect?",OTHERS,PENNY
3713,I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3714,"Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.",PENNY,PENNY
3715,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?",PENNY,PENNY
3716,Really? That’s where I was born!,SHELDON,PENNY

3718,"No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.",LEONARD,PENNY

3722,"Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3723,Just reset the board.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3724,Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.,HOWARD,PENNY
3725,"You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.",SHELDON,PENNY
3726,I’ll try to catch it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3727,Well… I don’t know what to say.,LEONARD,PENNY
3728,"Well, there you go. Problem solved.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3729,It wasn’t funny.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3730,What if that burning food attracts animals?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3731,Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.,LEONARD,RAJ
3732,Should we tell everyone not to come?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3733,I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.,RAJ,HOWARD
3734,"I didn’t say you were, I just said she was cute.",PENNY,LEONARD
3735,Okay.,OTHERS,PENNY
3736,"Oh, my God, you are such a mama’s boy.",RAJ,PENNY
3737,"Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?",LEONARD,PENNY
3738,So needy.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3739,Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?,PENNY,PENNY
3740,I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.,SHELDON,LEONARD

3744,Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.,OTHERS,RAJ
3745,Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.,OTHERS,RAJ
3746,"Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3747,They said something about going there this summer.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3748,"But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3749,"Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3750,"You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3751,"You know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3752,You’re welcome. How is it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3753,"Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.",PENNY,PENNY
3754,"He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!",HOWARD,SHELDON
3755,"Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night.",HOWARD,RAJ
3756,I wasn’t screwing around with anyone.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3757,"Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.",RAJ,OTHERS
3758,You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3759,"No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own.",PENNY,SHELDON
3760,Do I get some sympathy now?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3761,Morning.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3762,"I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3763,"You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3764,"I think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3765,"Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?",SHELDON,RAJ
3766,What?,RAJ,LEONARD
3767,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3768,Oh. I am.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3769,"Oh, that’s very interesting.",PENNY,SHELDON
3770,"No, you don’t. It’s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.",HOWARD,RAJ
3771,Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3772,I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3773,Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3774,Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3775,What exactly do you think goes on here?,PENNY,SHELDON
3776,Did he get superpowers?,RAJ,LEONARD
3777,Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3778,This place is great.,PENNY,LEONARD
3779,How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3780,This is ridiculous.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3781,It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.,PENNY,SHELDON
3782,"Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?",PENNY,SHELDON
3783,"Come on, take me to work with you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3784,"Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?",PENNY,PENNY
3785,Fine. There.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3786,How did you get so brave all of a sudden?,HOWARD,OTHERS
3787,"Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3788,"Oh, no.",PENNY,SHELDON
3789,I believe you two have prepared vows?,RAJ,SHELDON
3790,"Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.",RAJ,PENNY
3791,"Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?",RAJ,HOWARD
3792,"I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3793,That doesn’t help.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3794,"Oh, thank God.",LEONARD,PENNY
3795,Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3796,"Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.",RAJ,LEONARD
3797,"Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3798,Make it so.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3799,That is a daring and insightful solution.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3800,Sounds great.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3801,"That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3802,So what happened? How’d it go?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3803,Then get the regular!,HOWARD,SHELDON
3804,Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3805,What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?,PENNY,LEONARD
3806,"Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3807,"Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall.",PENNY,LEONARD
3808,"Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3809,Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3810,"Okay, Raj, I know you’ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3811,"Well, that can’t be right.",SHELDON,PENNY
3812,"Well, how much you got in there?",PENNY,PENNY
3813,I just want to talk to her.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3814,"Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3815,This is really fun.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3816,Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3817,"Go away, Sheldon.",PENNY,LEONARD
3818,"No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3819,"Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?",LEONARD,PENNY
3820,"They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3821,"I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3822,"Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3823,"Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3824,You managed the situation?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3825,"Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3826,Well…,SHELDON,LEONARD
3827,Are you comfortable?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3828,"Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3829,Well this is an interesting development.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3830,Right there with you.,PENNY,LEONARD
3831,I will.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3832,I don’t like trains. You like trains.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3833,Like my husband?,OTHERS,OTHERS
3834,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3835,"Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.",PENNY,SHELDON
3836,"Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.",PENNY,PENNY
3837,"People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3838,"Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3839,It’s not your fault.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3840,"Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3841,"So, what are you saying?",PENNY,PENNY
3842,He just left another comment.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3843,"Well, sweetie, that’s crazy.",PENNY,PENNY
3844,I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3845,"There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.",LEONARD,RAJ
3846,"Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3847,"Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!",LEONARD,LEONARD
3848,"Oh, did you meet her at work?",HOWARD,PENNY
3849,"You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?",LEONARD,PENNY
3850,I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3851,I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3852,Bye.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3853,"Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3854,Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.,RAJ,LEONARD
3855,"Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3856,"well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.",PENNY,PENNY
3857,"We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.",PENNY,LEONARD
3858,It’s getting creepy again.,PENNY,LEONARD
3859,Nobody thought that.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3860,"Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?",RAJ,LEONARD
3861,"Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.",SHELDON,PENNY
3862,You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.,PENNY,LEONARD
3863,The kid got a girl.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3864,No.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3865,Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3866,"Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3867,What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3868,And I’d like to think Howie wouldn’t take a job I was uncomfortable with.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3869,What you doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3870,"So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?",RAJ,LEONARD
3871,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3872,What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used.,RAJ,SHELDON
3873,We’re not going to give up just like that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3874,So?,PENNY,LEONARD
3875,I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?,OTHERS,PENNY
3876,I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3877,"Ah, much better.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3878,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3879,It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3880,Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.,RAJ,SHELDON
3881,"Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.",PENNY,HOWARD
3882,"You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3883,"But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?",RAJ,SHELDON
3884,"Yeah, he walked right into our trap.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3885,"Sure, go ahead.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3886,"Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3887,"Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you.",PENNY,RAJ
3888,"So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?",PENNY,HOWARD
3889,"Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3890,Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3891,"Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3892,"I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3893,You only had one.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3894,Who’s Adam West?,PENNY,LEONARD
3895,"Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.",RAJ,RAJ
3896,"Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3897,And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3898,I am.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3899,Then our problem would be solved.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3900,"Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it.",RAJ,LEONARD
3901,"No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.",OTHERS,PENNY
3902,Sounds good.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3903,Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3904,It was cute.,PENNY,OTHERS
3905,All right. I’ll have to go shopping.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3906,"You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.",PENNY,LEONARD
3907,"Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3908,"Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3909,Raj.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3910,Bye.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3911,Ew.,RAJ,PENNY
3912,Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3913,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3914,"All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.",PENNY,SHELDON
3915,I still don’t know why you left.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3916,Fair enough.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3917,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3918,"Well, aren’t you sweet?",PENNY,OTHERS
3919,Car.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3920,"Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3921,"I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3922,"Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we’ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior.",RAJ,RAJ
3923,"I’m sorry, no.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3924,Oh. It’s Stuart.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3925,"Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.",PENNY,SHELDON
3926,"Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?",HOWARD,LEONARD
3927,"Oh, grow up.",RAJ,PENNY
3928,"Oh, nothing. Just some math we don’t need.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3929,"Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.",OTHERS,PENNY
3930,"Oh, does that come up much on the space station?",PENNY,HOWARD
3931,I’m still confused.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3932,"You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em.",SHELDON,PENNY
3933,"Okay, well, that’s a problem.",RAJ,PENNY
3934,"Well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?",OTHERS,HOWARD
3935,It was really no problem.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3936,"What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.",LEONARD,RAJ
3937,"When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3938,"Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3939,And why would no one blame me?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3940,"Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3941,I came as quickly as I could.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3942,At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3943,I have no choice.,RAJ,SHELDON
3944,What’s wrong? You look upset.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3945,Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3946,I want soup.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3947,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.,RAJ,RAJ
3948,What’s in the bag?,RAJ,LEONARD
3949,"You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3950,What’s this?,PENNY,PENNY
3951,"For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.",SHELDON,RAJ
3952,I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.,SHELDON,OTHERS
3953,"Oh, God, I wish I had.",LEONARD,PENNY
3954,Huh?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3955,"No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.",LEONARD,PENNY
3956,"So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?",RAJ,PENNY
3957,"You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3958,Stop yelling at me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3959,"Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3960,Howard…,LEONARD,LEONARD
3961,"Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.",PENNY,PENNY
3962,"I told you, turn them inside out.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3963,Oh. I thought we were just friends.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3964,"Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3965,May.,PENNY,SHELDON
3966,Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?,PENNY,SHELDON
3967,So go apologize.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3968,"Leonard, please. His mother just died.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3969,"Okay, a simple yes will do.",PENNY,LEONARD
3970,Thank you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3971,"You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.",SHELDON,PENNY
3972,It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3973,Because…,SHELDON,LEONARD
3974,He just made that easier.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3975,Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3976,"Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him.",RAJ,RAJ
3977,Great.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3978,"Now that Sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?",RAJ,LEONARD

3980,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
3981,Are you going to confront Penny?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3982,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD

3984,"No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3985,"I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3986,It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.,HOWARD,PENNY
3987,I don’t understand. What’s he doing here?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3988,It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3989,"Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people.",OTHERS,PENNY
3990,That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3991,"Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3992,"Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3993,"Shake it baby, shake it!",PENNY,HOWARD

3995,"Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3996,Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?,RAJ,SHELDON
3997,Leslie Winkle?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3998,"He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.",PENNY,HOWARD
3999,"Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4000,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4001,Why not?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4002,"Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.",PENNY,PENNY
4003,"Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.",RAJ,SHELDON
4004,"Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4005,"Well, I went over to Mike’s to make up with him.",PENNY,HOWARD
4006,I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.,HOWARD,SHELDON

4008,"Oh, hey.",RAJ,LEONARD
4009,Thanks for the lift.,RAJ,HOWARD
4010,All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.,RAJ,SHELDON
4011,"No, of course not.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4012,"Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4013,I don’t care about that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4014,Mm-hmm. Hmm.,PENNY,PENNY
4015,That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4016,"Sorry, I have company.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4017,"Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.",LEONARD,PENNY
4018,The bastard teleported.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4019,"Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.",RAJ,PENNY
4020,Yep.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4021,You know what? Go put on your bus pants.,LEONARD,PENNY
4022,I don’t know if I can do that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4023,Clever.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4024,It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4025,"Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?",RAJ,PENNY
4026,I have.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4027,Howard?,OTHERS,SHELDON

4029,"No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.",PENNY,HOWARD
4030,"Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?",LEONARD,SHELDON
4031,"Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!",RAJ,RAJ
4032,They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4033,Or we could just stay here.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4034,"And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4035,"I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4036,Me-wow.,LEONARD,PENNY
4037,"Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.",PENNY,PENNY

4039,Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4040,It’s not definite. I’ll talk to Bernadette.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4041,"Sheldon, take it easy.",PENNY,LEONARD
4042,I didn’t. Let’s go.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4043,"Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.",PENNY,PENNY
4044,Glaringly obvious. Go on.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4045,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
4046,"On Earth, we say thank you.",PENNY,RAJ

4048,"No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.",PENNY,PENNY
4049,Woo-hoo!,RAJ,LEONARD
4050,Don’t worry. I’ll avoid the nether yea.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4051,As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.,PENNY,OTHERS
4052,"He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.",LEONARD,RAJ
4053,"Yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?",HOWARD,PENNY
4054,"Well, never hurts to have a spare.",PENNY,HOWARD
4055,"Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4056,"So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4057,"Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4058,"Yeah,",RAJ,LEONARD

4061,"Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.",LEONARD,HOWARD
4062,There you go– three against one.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4063,"See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4064,No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4065,"Come on, let’s get a drink.",RAJ,LEONARD
4066,He doesn’t have it. He’s got squat.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4067,"Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4068,Not if it has a hole in the middle.,RAJ,LEONARD
4069,"You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4070,"Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4071,"Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4072,"Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.",RAJ,SHELDON
4073,"A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4074,"I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”",SHELDON,SHELDON
4075,"Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?",LEONARD,SHELDON
4076,"Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4077,Can I speak to you for a second?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4078,What did you tell your boss?,OTHERS,LEONARD

4082,Probably. What’s your point?,LEONARD,PENNY
4083,"Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?",OTHERS,PENNY
4084,"It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.",PENNY,HOWARD
4085,What took you so long?,RAJ,LEONARD
4086,"Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4087,That’s odd.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4088,"Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…",PENNY,PENNY
4089,I don’t know what to do.,PENNY,LEONARD
4090,"Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4091,"Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!",OTHERS,SHELDON
4092,Just look at the board.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4093,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD

4098,"Hold on. Nope, no reason.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4099,What’s wrong with you?,RAJ,LEONARD
4100,"Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.",PENNY,PENNY
4101,"We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter…  I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4102,"Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not.",HOWARD,SHELDON

4104,Do anything interesting today?,LEONARD,OTHERS
4105,Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!,SHELDON,SHELDON

4107,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4108,Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.,LEONARD,RAJ
4109,Nice try. I’m not going.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4110,It’s still my turn.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4111,A summons for what?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4112,They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4113,God!,PENNY,LEONARD
4114,"Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4115,"Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.",PENNY,SHELDON
4116,"Okay, bye.  Means I wish you weren’t going.",PENNY,PENNY
4117,What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4118,"That’s strike one, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON
4119,"Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.",RAJ,SHELDON
4120,"I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4121,"That’s ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.",HOWARD,RAJ
4122,I don’t need a vacation.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4123,"Not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4124,"Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4125,"Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4126,"Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he’s nice and funny, but…",PENNY,PENNY
4127,You know they’re making jewellery right?,HOWARD,HOWARD
4128,"No, come on, now, we’re going out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4129,"Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.",PENNY,PENNY
4130,My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.,HOWARD,SHELDON

4132,"Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?",PENNY,PENNY
4133,How so?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4134,Right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4135,"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4136,"All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…",SHELDON,SHELDON
4137,It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.,SHELDON,RAJ
4138,Really? We’re going to do an experiment?,PENNY,LEONARD
4139,But why?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4140,And now what?,SHELDON,PENNY
4141,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4142,We’re on the same planet.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4143,Some of us might have the correct answers too.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4144,"Yeah, it is.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4145,"Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding.",RAJ,RAJ
4146,What? That’s great. Guys.,LEONARD,PENNY
4147,"Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.",OTHERS,PENNY

4153,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
4154,Not that I’ve ever seen.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4155,"Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.",SHELDON,OTHERS

4165,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4166,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4167,This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?,SHELDON,SHELDON

4169,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4170,"Bueno, mi amigo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4171,"Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.",PENNY,HOWARD
4172,"It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.",LEONARD,SHELDON

4186,"Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?",OTHERS,PENNY
4187,"Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?",PENNY,PENNY
4188,We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?,RAJ,SHELDON
4189,I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?,RAJ,HOWARD
4190,Ladies?  Ladies?  Ladies?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4191,It’s fine. You just need two more nails.,HOWARD,LEONARD

4196,Only without the sex.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4197,"Yes, he did. He absolutely did.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4198,"That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don’t know, do you? What’s the matter, smart guy? Don’t know Poiseuille’s law?",HOWARD,SHELDON
4199,"I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4200,"Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?",SHELDON,LEONARD

4234,"You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.",PENNY,PENNY
4235,You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.,SHELDON,SHELDON

4253,"You, you know you’re describing a dog.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4254,"Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4255,"Good morning, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4256,Nothing.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4257,"We’ll miss you, Sheldon.",LEONARD,OTHERS
4258,I’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4259,"Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?",SHELDON,OTHERS
4260,"Oh, they’re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.",PENNY,PENNY
4261,We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.,PENNY,LEONARD
4262,That’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4263,"The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path.",RAJ,LEONARD
4264,How do I look?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4265,I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…,SHELDON,LEONARD
4266,Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4267,Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.,SHELDON,RAJ
4268,I wonder how they smell.,RAJ,SHELDON
4269,"Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.",OTHERS,RAJ
4270,Yes?,PENNY,SHELDON
4271,Stop it. Stop celebrating me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4272,I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.,PENNY,RAJ
4273,"That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?",RAJ,SHELDON
4274,"Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4275,"Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4276,Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4277,I never thought about it like that.,PENNY,LEONARD
4278,That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4279,"Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.",RAJ,SHELDON
4280,What’s that?,OTHERS,PENNY
4281,"I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4282,"No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4283,"Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4284,Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?,PENNY,HOWARD
4285,"Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?",HOWARD,HOWARD
4286,A powerful laxative.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4287,Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!,OTHERS,SHELDON
4288,Had no idea you were the chatty one.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4289,She’s my champion.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4290,Careful. That’s a collectible.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4291,It’s great to see you too. Come on in.,PENNY,OTHERS
4292,"I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board.  What’s going on?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4293,"Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4294,"Oh, that’s an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4295,"I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.",LEONARD,RAJ
4296,Which one picks last?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4297,And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.,OTHERS,OTHERS
4298,She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.,RAJ,SHELDON
4299,Sorry. My phone.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4300,W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.,RAJ,RAJ
4301,Girls.,PENNY,SHELDON
4302,"Okay, look, it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4303,So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4304,Where’s Batman?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4305,"Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t",LEONARD,LEONARD
4306,"Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4307,"But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4308,"You have your learner’s permit, right?",PENNY,SHELDON
4309,We’d still get in.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4310,"I really want that, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4311,It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4312,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
4313,You had a lucky hunch.,PENNY,HOWARD
4314,"Yes, we did, Kripke.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4315,"I don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?",PENNY,PENNY
4316,There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4317,"Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day, I’m already causing problems.",RAJ,LEONARD
4318,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4319,"Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4320,"Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4321,Wait. What? What do I make you do?,HOWARD,PENNY
4322,I got lost.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4323,"Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?",PENNY,PENNY
4324,Apparently.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4325,"Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.",HOWARD,PENNY
4326,"Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4327,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4328,We must not be playing it right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4329,"Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4330,"I’d love to, but I don’t have tangerine chicken.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4331,"Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4332,"Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4333,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
4334,How old was it,OTHERS,LEONARD
4335,"Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4336,"This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4337,"Party with the pretty girls, dude!",RAJ,RAJ
4338,"I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas.",PENNY,SHELDON
4339,Will you stop with that already?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4340,Spaghetti okay?,PENNY,PENNY
4341,Should we call Howard and Bernadette?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4342,Very well done.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4343,"Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4344,"Wait, I don’t, which part?",LEONARD,PENNY
4345,Get out!,PENNY,LEONARD
4346,"Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.",RAJ,PENNY
4347,Knock-knock.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4348,I’m not pressuring you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4349,"To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.",PENNY,SHELDON
4350,And begin. This is kind of creepy.,PENNY,SHELDON
4351,It’s nine o’clock.,PENNY,LEONARD
4352,Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4353,"Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?",LEONARD,HOWARD
4354,You’re kidding.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4355,"Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4356,Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4357,You were acting?,PENNY,LEONARD
4358,"There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4359,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4360,"Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.",RAJ,PENNY
4361,"I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?",HOWARD,OTHERS
4362,Borrowed?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4363,"Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream.",RAJ,PENNY
4364,"Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.",RAJ,SHELDON
4365,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4366,"You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.",PENNY,HOWARD
4367,"Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4368,"Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.",SHELDON,RAJ
4369,You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4370,Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4371,"Yay, so we’re good.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4372,"Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.",SHELDON,PENNY
4373,"If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4374,"Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.",PENNY,SHELDON
4375,I envy you your childhood.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4376,Just shut up.,PENNY,LEONARD
4377,Wow. I’m impressed.,HOWARD,OTHERS
4378,Why is that good?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4379,Please?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4380,I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4381,"Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.",PENNY,LEONARD
4382,"Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4383,"Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.",SHELDON,PENNY
4384,How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a friend.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4385,Why?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4386,Very.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4387,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4388,"Well, she did. And human resources.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4389,"Fine. Howard, what do you do?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4390,Very. Leonard is so great.,PENNY,SHELDON
4391,"You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.",PENNY,PENNY
4392,I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.,PENNY,LEONARD
4393,"No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off.",OTHERS,OTHERS
4394,I guess the experiment begins.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4395,I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?,HOWARD,PENNY
4396,"No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4397,Then why did I have to crawl?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4398,What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4399,I kiss you on the lips.,OTHERS,OTHERS
4400,"Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4401,"Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4402,"Because there’s only one of me, I’m more valuable.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4403,"Hey, how’s dating two women going?",LEONARD,PENNY
4404,Shut up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4405,"Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4406,"Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?",PENNY,PENNY
4407,"Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?",LEONARD,RAJ
4408,My mother said that’s how good girls do it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4409,You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4410,No.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4411,"No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4412,I go to the bathroom like everybody else.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4413,Sleep.,PENNY,SHELDON
4414,"Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.",RAJ,SHELDON
4415,"Mm. Well, we’ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?",PENNY,PENNY
4416,Make a baby? What are you talking about?,OTHERS,HOWARD
4417,"Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?",PENNY,PENNY
4418,Leonard?,PENNY,SHELDON
4419,"You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.",OTHERS,PENNY
4420,"Hi, Sheldon.",OTHERS,PENNY
4421,"Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.",OTHERS,RAJ
4422,"Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.",PENNY,PENNY
4423,Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.,OTHERS,RAJ
4424,"Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!",LEONARD,HOWARD
4425,"No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.",PENNY,PENNY
4426,"No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss.",PENNY,LEONARD
4427,"Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship.",RAJ,SHELDON
4428,You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4429,What did we miss?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4430,"Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.",PENNY,SHELDON
4431,"Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought.",PENNY,LEONARD
4432,You’re not listening to my side of it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4433,"We know what’s going on, Sheldon!",PENNY,LEONARD
4434,Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  That’s new.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4435,The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4436,"He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4437,And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4438,"Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?",OTHERS,PENNY
4439,I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4440,Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4441,I think so.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4442,"Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4443,Is it Penny?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4444,"What, you’re a zebra, right?",OTHERS,LEONARD
4445,You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4446,"If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4447,"Hey, here’s your tip from table seven.",PENNY,HOWARD
4448,"Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn’t get it and I couldn’t figure out why?",PENNY,PENNY
4449,"Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.",LEONARD,PENNY
4450,"Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.",LEONARD,RAJ
4451,"Oh, my God. What happened?",PENNY,PENNY
4452,"Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.",PENNY,PENNY
4453,"And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4454,But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?,SHELDON,LEONARD
4455,I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4456,"Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.",PENNY,PENNY
4457,"Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?",OTHERS,PENNY
4458,Have you? How am I feeling right now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4459,"Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.",HOWARD,PENNY
4460,"Uh, I was out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4461,How could you?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4462,I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4463,Were you aware of this?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4464,"Okay, we should, we should go.",PENNY,LEONARD
4465,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
4466,"It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4467,Sorry.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4468,What is that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4469,"Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?",PENNY,PENNY
4470,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
4471,"Yeah, get it, girl.",PENNY,HOWARD
4472,"All right, so we’ll ask him to come back.",PENNY,PENNY
4473,"We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4474,That’d be great.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4475,"O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you, is everything good?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4476,The guy who invented it says it’s jif.,RAJ,HOWARD
4477,Howard has a heart condition! You know that!,OTHERS,SHELDON
4478,"Not really, no.",PENNY,LEONARD
4479,"Lookie here, I got my travel orders.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4480,You won.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4481,She’s great. Look.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4482,Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.,RAJ,LEONARD
4483,"Yes, but that’s not the point! Get me out of here.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4484,"Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4485,And don’t ever call me Shelly.,SHELDON,HOWARD
4486,"And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4487,"I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.",RAJ,LEONARD
4488,"Come on, it’ll be fun.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4489,"That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4490,I think we’re good.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4491,It must’ve killed you when I went to space.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4492,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4493,Yeah. And that’s my bid.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4494,"Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.",OTHERS,PENNY
4495,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4496,"Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4497,Helium.,PENNY,SHELDON
4498,You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4499,"Emergency drill night last night, huh?",HOWARD,LEONARD
4500,Mm-hmm.,LEONARD,PENNY
4501,You lied to me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
4502,What’s your name?,PENNY,LEONARD
4503,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4504,"It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4505,"No, she had dental insurance.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4506,"Oh, you heard?",LEONARD,PENNY
4507,"Oh, hello.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4508,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4509,"So, why was it his lucky day?",PENNY,PENNY
4510,"Thank you, Sheldon.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4511,"I do, with all my heart.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4512,Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4513,Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4514,We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4515,Were you in the original trilogy?,HOWARD,SHELDON
4516,"Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4517,Really? So it’s okay if I fl…,HOWARD,PENNY
4518,It is freaking amazing.,PENNY,LEONARD
4519,"All I’ve got is a needler, and I’m all out of ammo.",RAJ,HOWARD
4520,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4521,"I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4522,I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4523,"Okay, I’m not driving him.",PENNY,PENNY
4524,"I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.",SHELDON,SHELDON

4526,"Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.",PENNY,PENNY
4527,"Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?",HOWARD,HOWARD
4528,Oh! I love trains!,SHELDON,SHELDON

4533,"Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.",PENNY,SHELDON
4534,"And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.",SHELDON,RAJ
4535,Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4536,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no…",SHELDON,LEONARD
4537,"I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4538,"No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please.",PENNY,LEONARD
4539,Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4540,"Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.",PENNY,PENNY
4541,So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4542,It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4543,Why did you have to make him happy?,PENNY,LEONARD
4544,Anything yet?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4545,That is what is referred to as a burn on you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4546,"Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS
4547,"Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.",RAJ,LEONARD
4548,How could you say that?,RAJ,SHELDON
4549,"All right, I will tell him you called.",OTHERS,PENNY
4550,"We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?",OTHERS,SHELDON
4551,Which is?,PENNY,LEONARD
4552,"I do, all the time.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4553,"Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.",RAJ,LEONARD
4554,Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4555,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
4556,"Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4557,"Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?",OTHERS,SHELDON
4558,Stuart. He’s been living with us for a while now. I’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.,OTHERS,OTHERS
4559,"I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4560,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of…",LEONARD,SHELDON
4561,"Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.",PENNY,PENNY
4562,"Well, I wish I could.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4563,"Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4564,"Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time.",PENNY,PENNY
4565,"Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…",HOWARD,HOWARD
4566,Maybe he’s not for you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4567,Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?,PENNY,SHELDON
4568,We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.,OTHERS,RAJ
4569,"Aw, you picked up on that huh?",LEONARD,PENNY
4570,"Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4571,"You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.",OTHERS,PENNY
4572,Of course not. Look at her.,RAJ,LEONARD
4573,"No, that’s okay.",OTHERS,PENNY
4574,"Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.",LEONARD,PENNY
4575,"I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?",RAJ,HOWARD
4576,"Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4577,Problem.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4578,"He said start with it, not end with it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4579,"You know, you’re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4580,I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…,PENNY,HOWARD
4581,"For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4582,I saw Slumdog Millionaire.,OTHERS,RAJ
4583,"It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!",SHELDON,SHELDON
4584,"Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.",SHELDON,PENNY
4585,I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.,LEONARD,PENNY
4586,"I did. You know, I’m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4587,But that’s my room.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4588,"Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4589,Read it back one more time.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4590,"Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4591,"Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.",PENNY,LEONARD
4592,Well why not?,PENNY,SHELDON
4593,You realize you can’t win.,RAJ,SHELDON
4594,But the Chinese team found the element.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4595,"Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4596,Thank you. I feel better now.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4597,"Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!",SHELDON,HOWARD
4598,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.",PENNY,OTHERS
4599,"Well, hello.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4600,Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4601,"Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. I’m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?",HOWARD,HOWARD
4602,"God, he’s an ass when he drinks.",PENNY,PENNY
4603,"I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4604,"Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.",PENNY,RAJ
4605,It’s okay. They apologized.,OTHERS,LEONARD

4607,"Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4608,Oh…!,LEONARD,SHELDON
4609,Yep.,PENNY,LEONARD
4610,We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4611,Give me those damn Pringles.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4612,"Yeah, we’re good.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4613,"Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4614,"Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.",LEONARD,PENNY
4615,"Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now.",OTHERS,PENNY
4616,"Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4617,I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.,RAJ,OTHERS
4618,"Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4619,I think we were misled about the cute girls.,RAJ,RAJ
4620,What am I doing in your spam folder?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4621,"I hope it’s good news, because I’ve got nothing but disappointment in here!",OTHERS,SHELDON
4622,Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4623,Why won’t you sign it?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4624,"Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.",OTHERS,OTHERS
4625,Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.,PENNY,SHELDON
4626,"You know, I’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?",PENNY,SHELDON

4631,"Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4632,She already likes soap bubbles more than us.,HOWARD,RAJ
4633,I don’t like it either.,LEONARD,OTHERS
4634,"Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4635,A little.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4636,"Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…",SHELDON,SHELDON
4637,"Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4638,"But you don’t have sex with her, either.",RAJ,LEONARD
4639,"There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4640,I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.,RAJ,OTHERS

4646,"Raj, your tag’s sticking out.",OTHERS,HOWARD

4648,"You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all’s coming?",PENNY,LEONARD
4649,What are you doing?,PENNY,SHELDON
4650,Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4651,"Sure, we could write something up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4652,"Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4653,"You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4654,Just one more bite.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4655,"Um, I never really thought about it. Why?",PENNY,PENNY
4656,You’re in my bedroom.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4657,"Sure, whatever.",RAJ,LEONARD
4658,"Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4659,"Excuse me.  A couple of circulars, nothing important.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4660,"What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?",RAJ,PENNY
4661,"I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.",LEONARD,OTHERS
4662,And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.,LEONARD,RAJ
4663,Since always.,PENNY,LEONARD
4664,"Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4665,"Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?",PENNY,SHELDON
4666,"So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?",RAJ,LEONARD
4667,You think he’ll notice?,PENNY,SHELDON
4668,"Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4669,Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4670,What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.,PENNY,PENNY
4671,"Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?",LEONARD,HOWARD
4672,"You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4673,"Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.",PENNY,RAJ
4674,Yes. Why don’t you come over to my table.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4675,"Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.",SHELDON,SHELDON

4677,"I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4678,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4679,"It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4680,"No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4681,You can do this.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4682,All right. Can I help you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4683,So why don’t you do that with them?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4684,You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4685,"Howie, it’s in poor taste.",OTHERS,OTHERS
4686,"All right, very funny.",HOWARD,PENNY
4687,"Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.",RAJ,HOWARD
4688,"Leonard, help.",PENNY,SHELDON
4689,"Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4690,I’ll get them.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4691,I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4692,"Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4693,Yes.,RAJ,LEONARD
4694,"Then who did sew it, hmm?",OTHERS,SHELDON
4695,"Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.",PENNY,SHELDON
4696,"I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4697,"Kurt, put him down this instant.",PENNY,LEONARD

4699,"Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4700,"Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4701,"No, it’s okay. What?",HOWARD,PENNY
4702,"Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!",LEONARD,SHELDON
4703,Me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4704,"This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4705,I’ll let you get back to your date.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4706,I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4707,Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4708,"I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4709,"I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.",RAJ,SHELDON
4710,"Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.",PENNY,OTHERS
4711,"I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4712,"All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4713,It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.,HOWARD,OTHERS
4714,Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4715,"If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.",RAJ,SHELDON
4716,"Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4717,"Okay, sweetie, I know you think you’re explaining yourself, but you’re really not.",PENNY,PENNY
4718,What the hell is going on?,LEONARD,PENNY
4719,"I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?",OTHERS,OTHERS
4720,"Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.",HOWARD,PENNY
4721,I had a good time.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4722,"You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?",OTHERS,PENNY
4723,Mahalo’s a nice touch.,LEONARD,RAJ
4724,I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4725,Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?,RAJ,SHELDON
4726,That soft pink alien looks delicious.,OTHERS,RAJ
4727,You’re not doing that right.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4728,"Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4729,"Um, Penny, that’s where I sit.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4730,Then you made her cry and leave.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4731,Sure. I did the one with the frogs.,PENNY,LEONARD
4732,"Oh, I know, I’m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?",OTHERS,PENNY
4733,My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.,RAJ,RAJ

4735,That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.,RAJ,LEONARD

4739,That’s not the point.,RAJ,LEONARD
4740,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
4741,You all right?,OTHERS,PENNY
4742,"Yes, absolutely fine.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4743,Here you go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4744,What if each of those people let someone cut?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4745,No.,RAJ,LEONARD
4746,That was kind of icy. You two okay?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4747,"Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4748,Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!,OTHERS,HOWARD
4749,"Don’t worry, Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour.",RAJ,HOWARD
4750,Uh-huh.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4751,Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4752,She seems nice.,OTHERS,OTHERS
4753,"Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4754,And he’s all white.,RAJ,RAJ
4755,Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4756,"Yeah, well, sadly, I do.",PENNY,SHELDON
4757,"Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4758,It is?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4759,Really? He doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4760,He’s not gonna make it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4761,It’s great. I love it.,LEONARD,OTHERS
4762,"Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4763,"Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4764,"Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?",LEONARD,PENNY
4765,It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4766,No! I call no Meemaws.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4767,What did she say? Is she still mad at me?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4768,"Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4769,"Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise.",RAJ,PENNY
4770,I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4771,"Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4772,Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.,RAJ,SHELDON
4773,"Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?",HOWARD,SHELDON
4774,You work with her? How could you not tell me that?,PENNY,LEONARD
4775,I knew I could smell ’em.,PENNY,OTHERS
4776,Are you done?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4777,"Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?",LEONARD,PENNY
4778,"Great, so what do you need me for?",OTHERS,PENNY
4779,"Again, it was miniature golf.",PENNY,SHELDON
4780,"I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.",PENNY,PENNY
4781,I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!,OTHERS,HOWARD
4782,I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4783,Is something bothering you?,PENNY,LEONARD
4784,"Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4785,Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4786,So what happens next?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4787,What’s going on here?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4788,Mmm.,PENNY,LEONARD
4789,I’m a real collector. How rare is it?,SHELDON,RAJ
4790,Leonard?,PENNY,SHELDON
4791,"Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?",RAJ,LEONARD
4792,"Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel.",SHELDON,PENNY
4793,"Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4794,Hi.,OTHERS,PENNY

4804,What? Why?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4805,Leonard told me to stay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4806,We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4807,"Oh my God, why did you eat it?",LEONARD,PENNY
4808,Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4809,"I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4810,Is he serious?,PENNY,LEONARD
4811,"I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.",RAJ,OTHERS
4812,You know I’ve been wanting to go.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4813,"Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.",PENNY,PENNY
4814,Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.,HOWARD,RAJ
4815,No. It’s not the message.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4816,Because I beat you.,PENNY,SHELDON
4817,Yeah.,HOWARD,LEONARD

4819,"God, no.",SHELDON,PENNY
4820,Exactly.,PENNY,SHELDON
4821,"Well, Sheldon, you’re his friend. Friends give each other presents.",PENNY,PENNY
4822,"Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.",LEONARD,RAJ

4828,Aftershock.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4829,Glass of wine?,PENNY,SHELDON

4832,Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?,RAJ,RAJ
4833,"If he were dying, would you sleep with him?",OTHERS,LEONARD
4834,"Hi. Hey, where’s your fiancée?",PENNY,PENNY
4835,"No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.",LEONARD,HOWARD
4836,"Okay, so you’re saying I should go out with Leonard.",PENNY,PENNY
4837,"I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.",SHELDON,RAJ

4843,Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.,SHELDON,RAJ
4844,Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4845,"Did you get a cold, too?",RAJ,LEONARD
4846,"Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…",LEONARD,OTHERS
4847,"Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4848,"Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You’d also have to be knighted for that to apply.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4849,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4850,"Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4851,Actually there’s no proof of that.,RAJ,LEONARD

4858,"More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?",RAJ,SHELDON

4864,"I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.",LEONARD,OTHERS
4865,You want me to get eye surgery?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4866,The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4867,"Oh. Well, that’s disappointing.",RAJ,SHELDON
4868,"Sheldon, what’s going on?",OTHERS,PENNY

4879,Are you?,RAJ,SHELDON
4880,"Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4881,Whatever.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4882,Like who?,RAJ,LEONARD

4885,"Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.",OTHERS,OTHERS

4892,"Nope, never.",PENNY,LEONARD

4896,You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago.  I’d just started at the university.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4897,"I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.",HOWARD,SHELDON

4919,Oh.,LEONARD,PENNY
4920,Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.,PENNY,SHELDON
4921,"Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4922,"Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.",RAJ,SHELDON
4923,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4924,Are you still mad at me?,SHELDON,SHELDON

4931,You’re welcome to come.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4932,"Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4933,"Excuse me, we’re ready.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4934,"Hey, Cuddles.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4935,Was it?,OTHERS,LEONARD

4941,Thanks.,PENNY,OTHERS
4942,"No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him.

4947,We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.,LEONARD,HOWARD

5007,"Okay, well, I’ll take you.",LEONARD,PENNY
5008,I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.,LEONARD,SHELDON

5040,"Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.",LEONARD,LEONARD

5044,"Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you.

5079,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5080,"The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5081,"Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?",SHELDON,SHELDON
5082,"I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.",SHELDON,SHELDON

5109,It’s important you know how much you mean to us.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5110,"There you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.",PENNY,OTHERS
5111,You’re saying it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5112,"No, I’m a Hobbit.",LEONARD,SHELDON

5131,"Try to keep up, Howard, I’m killing it.",RAJ,LEONARD

5133,Are you asking me or telling me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5134,"No, it’s mine.",SHELDON,LEONARD

5143,"Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.",PENNY,HOWARD
5144,"No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.",RAJ,SHELDON
5145,"I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere.",RAJ,RAJ

5148,"Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.",SHELDON,SHELDON

5173,"Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5174,"Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.",PENNY,OTHERS
5175,"Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld.",HOWARD,RAJ
5176,It’s the groom.,HOWARD,OTHERS

5183,Okay. Shall we go to dinner?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5184,"Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5185,"Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.",RAJ,SHELDON
5186,What’s your excuse this time?,OTHERS,LEONARD
5187,"I love you, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS

5206,So does that mean we can go with the girls again?,RAJ,LEONARD
5207,"You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.",PENNY,PENNY
5208,"This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?",PENNY,PENNY
5209,"No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don’t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!",PENNY,SHELDON

5353,"Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5354,"Boy, it is neck and neck right now.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5355,"Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.",PENNY,PENNY
5356,Figure out the magic trick yet?,SHELDON,HOWARD
5357,"Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.",RAJ,HOWARD
5358,"There you go, one enchanted sword.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5359,En el acelerador de particulares.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5360,"Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5361,"Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5362,That does sound fun.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5363,"I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?",SHELDON,SHELDON
5364,Yellow. Go ahead.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5365,"Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.",RAJ,SHELDON
5366,Cinnamon!,OTHERS,HOWARD
5367,Interesting.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5368,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,PENNY
5369,"There’s your answer, free food.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5370,You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5371,"Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised.",HOWARD,PENNY
5372,Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?,RAJ,SHELDON
5373,"Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5374,"Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5375,Wait… what?,PENNY,PENNY
5376,"Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you.",LEONARD,PENNY
5377,"No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing.",RAJ,SHELDON
5378,She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.,LEONARD,HOWARD
5379,"You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?",HOWARD,SHELDON
5380,"Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5381,"No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.",PENNY,LEONARD
5382,"I’m telling you, something’s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5383,I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5384,"Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5385,"I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.",PENNY,HOWARD
5386,What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.,RAJ,PENNY
5387,You’re making it difficult to love you right now.,SHELDON,OTHERS
5388,Here we go.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5389,So we have to go back.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5390,Absolutely.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5391,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5392,"Boy, that’s brilliant, but I’ll see you.",PENNY,SHELDON
5393,I can’t stop thinking about it.,RAJ,LEONARD
5394,"I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5395,I will literally race you to the car.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5396,It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.,PENNY,SHELDON
5397,"It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5398,Change migraine to yes.,PENNY,SHELDON
5399,Kind of hard to see the names.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5400,Wait. What the hell is ding?,RAJ,PENNY
5401,"It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready.",RAJ,SHELDON
5402,Lack of confidence.,RAJ,SHELDON
5403,"Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5404,Doesn’t sound that bad.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5405,You can’t replace me with Zack.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5406,"Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5407,"Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5408,"I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5409,I can’t.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5410,Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.,OTHERS,OTHERS
5411,Sheldon.,RAJ,LEONARD
5412,I can’t tell you that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5413,"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5414,"Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5415,"Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…",LEONARD,PENNY
5416,"Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5417,"Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?",HOWARD,HOWARD
5418,"Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don’t know, some Indian meditation crap.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5419,Okay. Come on in.,RAJ,PENNY
5420,No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5421,I had to; we’re married now.,PENNY,OTHERS
5422,That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5423,Hugh who?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5424,Why didn’t you say anything?,RAJ,LEONARD
5425,"I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.",HOWARD,PENNY
5426,"I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5427,We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5428,"Okay, where is this coming from?",PENNY,PENNY
5429,"Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5430,"No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.",LEONARD,PENNY
5431,Mmm. My pleasure.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5432,"Sorry, Stuart.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5433,"Howard, could I borrow some after shave?",LEONARD,LEONARD
5434,Not at all. Amy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5435,I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.,RAJ,RAJ
5436,It’s nothing in particular. I…,HOWARD,SHELDON
5437,Let’s just agree they’re both hot.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5438,"Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5439,"I know. And those specials, they change every day.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5440,"And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.",LEONARD,RAJ
5441,Why is it your last name and her first name?,HOWARD,LEONARD
5442,"Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5443,Who says this is the only one I hid?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5444,He does.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5445,Arlene Russel.,HOWARD,HOWARD
5446,"Thank you, Sheldon.",PENNY,LEONARD
5447,Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5448,Oh. You mean like a museum?,OTHERS,PENNY
5449,"That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5450,Rotating.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5451,"Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”",SHELDON,SHELDON
5452,Speech! Speech!,LEONARD,SHELDON
5453,"Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!",SHELDON,SHELDON
5454,"So, where is it?",OTHERS,PENNY
5455,"Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn’t stick with it long enough to get your PhD?",OTHERS,SHELDON
5456,"If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5457,But we can’t.,PENNY,LEONARD
5458,"Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?",LEONARD,HOWARD
5459,"I’m just saying, second base is right there.",OTHERS,HOWARD
5460,What is it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5461,Your doom!,SHELDON,SHELDON
5462,"The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.",SHELDON,RAJ
5463,"All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?",OTHERS,HOWARD
5464,What’s wrong with your car?,HOWARD,LEONARD
5465,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5466,Thank you. It would be an honour.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5467,And what would I have said afterwards?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5468,"Sheldon, what is wrong with you?",PENNY,PENNY
5469,What about your girlfriend?,OTHERS,LEONARD
5470,They wouldn’t say.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5471,Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5472,"Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.",LEONARD,PENNY
5473,"Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5474,I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5475,"Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5476,"You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.",LEONARD,PENNY
5477,"It was a tutorial. And yes, I’m happy to keep Sheldon company.",RAJ,LEONARD
5478,Nope. Maybe another time.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5479,"Yeah, there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet.",PENNY,PENNY
5480,It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5481,Dude! I put that thing on my face!,RAJ,RAJ
5482,"Hey, what’s with all the yelling?",PENNY,PENNY
5483,"Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.",PENNY,PENNY
5484,Just do it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5485,Of course.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5486,Thank you very much. Thanks.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5487,I’ll pay you anything you want.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5488,The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5489,What are you doing here?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5490,"Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.",PENNY,PENNY
5491,My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,RAJ,RAJ
5492,My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.,SHELDON,OTHERS
5493,I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5494,"Open the pod bay doors, HAL.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5495,Get out.,PENNY,LEONARD
5496,"I’m not even engaged once. I don’t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I’m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…",OTHERS,PENNY
5497,"Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?",SHELDON,SHELDON
5498,A puppy once bit my face.,OTHERS,RAJ
5499,"Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5500,"Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5501,"Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5502,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5503,"Yeah, I’m proud of him, too.",LEONARD,PENNY
5504,I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5505,"Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?",LEONARD,PENNY
5506,"Raj, is that you?",HOWARD,LEONARD
5507,Maybe I should just go home.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5508,Good. Slow.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5509,"You had some nice moves out there, Howard.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5510,"Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell.",OTHERS,OTHERS
5511,That must be him.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5512,It’s just allergies.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5513,Isn’t it?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5514,"He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.",RAJ,LEONARD
5515,"No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5516,"Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?",OTHERS,HOWARD
5517,"I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5518,Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt,RAJ,HOWARD
5519,"Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5520,"Well, how did you guys become friends?",PENNY,PENNY
5521,Hey.,RAJ,LEONARD
5522,Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.,SHELDON,PENNY
5523,"Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?",OTHERS,LEONARD
5524,I’m getting worried.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5525,We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5526,"To drinking.  Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5527,"Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.",SHELDON,OTHERS
5528,"Hey, how’s it going?",HOWARD,PENNY
5529,He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5530,"Hey, can we please get back to work?",LEONARD,PENNY
5531,Pacific Daylight time!,SHELDON,SHELDON
5532,"So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?",SHELDON,SHELDON
5533,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5534,See? It’s working.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5535,"Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?",PENNY,PENNY
5536,Tell me the truth.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5537,All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5538,This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.,HOWARD,SHELDON
5539,"Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that baby’s broken.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5540,"You know she’s at my parents’ house, right?",OTHERS,HOWARD
5541,"No, but we knew that.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5542,Why did you do that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
5543,You want some of this? I’ll give you some.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5544,"Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5545,"Yes, very much.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5546,"Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.",PENNY,PENNY
5547,"I know! It’s not enough, is it? Here.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5548,"I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.",RAJ,SHELDON
5549,I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5550,Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5551,Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5552,Oh. I love those.,LEONARD,PENNY
5553,"No, nothing. We just changed our mind.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5554,"Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?",LEONARD,LEONARD
5555,So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.,PENNY,RAJ
5556,"Leonard’s fine. I’m fine, thanks for asking, by the way.",HOWARD,PENNY
5557,"Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?",HOWARD,LEONARD
5558,Do you feel better?,OTHERS,OTHERS
5559,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
5560,All right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5561,"Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?",LEONARD,LEONARD
5562,Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?,RAJ,SHELDON
5563,"Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?",LEONARD,PENNY
5564,I’m proud of you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
5565,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5566,Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5567,Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5568,You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.,OTHERS,HOWARD
5569,We should all take a trip or something.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5570,Isn’t she a pip?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5571,Who’s going to tell whom about what?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5572,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5573,"I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5574,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
5575,"To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5576,Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5577,Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.,PENNY,PENNY
5578,I think they say junk.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5579,"Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again.",OTHERS,PENNY
5580,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5581,"Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.",PENNY,PENNY
5582,It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5583,Terrified.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5584,"Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.",RAJ,PENNY
5585,"I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.",SHELDON,SHELDON

5587,You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?,LEONARD,HOWARD
5588,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5589,"Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even had sex yet.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5590,"Oh, jiminy, that’s cold.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5591,"Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.",LEONARD,RAJ
5592,"Sheldon, don’t ruin the game.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5593,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
5594,Do you really want to get into this right now?,PENNY,LEONARD
5595,Thanks. What are you guys doing?,PENNY,LEONARD
5596,"I’m sorry, were you talking to me?",LEONARD,LEONARD
5597,Now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5598,How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5599,We were badass back in the day.,RAJ,HOWARD

5606,So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5607,"Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into.",HOWARD,PENNY
5608,I’m busy.,PENNY,SHELDON
5609,Maybe I could do it.,PENNY,OTHERS
5610,I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.,OTHERS,HOWARD
5611,He does? Who is it?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5612,Let’s go.,HOWARD,OTHERS
5613,"Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.",PENNY,PENNY
5614,"Ah, me, too.",RAJ,HOWARD

5617,"Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.

5644,"Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.",PENNY,PENNY
5645,It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5646,"You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5647,"Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.",SHELDON,SHELDON

5656,Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5657,"I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.",PENNY,PENNY
5658,I’m okay.,OTHERS,LEONARD

5677,"Pause the game, Howard.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5678,You can recognize people on Google Earth?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5679,"No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.",OTHERS,HOWARD
5680,Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?,LEONARD,PENNY
5681,The new neighbours are weird.,PENNY,LEONARD
5682,"You didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?",HOWARD,HOWARD
5683,"Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?",OTHERS,OTHERS
5684,"What, why not?",SHELDON,PENNY
5685,"Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind.",LEONARD,PENNY

5700,Ask me why.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5701,You frightened me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5702,"According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5703,"Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
5704,A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.,SHELDON,SHELDON

5710,Good news. You’re an asteroid.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5711,I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.,HOWARD,OTHERS

5715,Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?,OTHERS,OTHERS

5724,"What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.",PENNY,PENNY
5725,You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5726,"You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.",LEONARD,PENNY
5727,"We, we can totally do that.",RAJ,LEONARD
5728,"I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.",RAJ,RAJ
5729,"You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.",SHELDON,RAJ
5730,"Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5731,"Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k…",LEONARD,PENNY
5732,Maybe you could run some computer simulations.,RAJ,HOWARD

5742,What’s going on?,PENNY,LEONARD
5743,"Well, you’re not gonna go with them?",PENNY,PENNY

5746,"Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.",HOWARD,PENNY
5747,"Missy, I’m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?",PENNY,RAJ

5752,You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?,RAJ,HOWARD
5753,Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.,HOWARD,HOWARD
5754,Oh. We should get going.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5755,"Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5756,"She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5757,I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5758,We need to talk about redecorating this place.,OTHERS,OTHERS
5759,Do I have a choice?,PENNY,SHELDON
5760,Really? I don’t even notice any more.,LEONARD,SHELDON

5762,One question.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5763,"Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.",HOWARD,PENNY

5770,"It was a long time ago, Howard.",OTHERS,LEONARD

5774,I won’t be there.,SHELDON,SHELDON

5777,"Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5778,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,PENNY
5779,Don’t do that.,LEONARD,LEONARD

5781,Since when do you hum songs?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5782,Not so good.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5783,What?,PENNY,LEONARD

5795,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
5796,"Sheldon, come here.",LEONARD,PENNY

5798,"Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.",RAJ,HOWARD
5799,How about a hearty handshake?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5800,"No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.",LEONARD,PENNY

5802,How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?,OTHERS,LEONARD

5808,"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.",RAJ,RAJ
5809,Not anymore.,OTHERS,LEONARD

5811,Anguish?,PENNY,SHELDON
5812,"Maybe, maybe.",RAJ,LEONARD
5813,Are you sure this is what you want to do?,SHELDON,LEONARD

5819,"Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes.

5821,How’d you do that?,RAJ,LEONARD

5837,"Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?",PENNY,PENNY
5838,"No. What I’m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.",PENNY,SHELDON

5917,"No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5918,"Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5919,What did you do?,PENNY,SHELDON
5920,"No, it’s not.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5921,Whoa! Did you see that?,HOWARD,SHELDON
5922,She’s not my girlfriend.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5923,She’s just being nice.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5924,He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.,LEONARD,OTHERS
5925,And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…,OTHERS,SHELDON
5926,"Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5927,"Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5928,I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.,HOWARD,SHELDON
5929,That’s very hurtful.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5930,How is that a T?,RAJ,LEONARD
5931,Can I hear one?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5932,Really? What do we tell Siebert?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5933,"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5934,Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.,HOWARD,LEONARD
5935,"Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can’t go through…",RAJ,HOWARD

5941,"Alright, come on, come on.",PENNY,LEONARD
5942,"Uh, that’s a great question, Zack.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5943,"Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5944,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.,SHELDON,SHELDON

5946,"Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?",LEONARD,LEONARD

5949,What the hell are you guys playing?,LEONARD,PENNY
5950,"Oh, I’ll wedge it right in there.",PENNY,LEONARD
5951,My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5952,So call her.,LEONARD,HOWARD
5953,His middle name is David. Go.,HOWARD,OTHERS
5954,Astro means star.,SHELDON,RAJ
5955,Same here!,HOWARD,LEONARD

5957,Thank you for walking me home.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5958,"Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5959,But change is a part of life.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5960,You would do that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
5961,That’s awfully personal.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5962,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5963,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON

5967,"Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?",HOWARD,HOWARD
5968,But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?,HOWARD,LEONARD
5969,"Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.",LEONARD,HOWARD
5970,"Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5971,"Sheldon, you are not in charge.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5972,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
5973,I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5974,My sister.,RAJ,RAJ

5987,"Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.",OTHERS,HOWARD
5988,Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5989,"Yes, we did.",PENNY,LEONARD
5990,"Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5991,"Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5992,Penny?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5993,"This is nice, that we all get to eat together.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5994,Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.,LEONARD,LEONARD

6005,"I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6006,"Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.",LEONARD,PENNY
6007,"Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?",OTHERS,PENNY
6008,A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6009,Say the quote again.,PENNY,SHELDON
6010,Are you hitting on me?,OTHERS,SHELDON
6011,"No, hang on, hang on.  See!",LEONARD,LEONARD
6012,Fascinating. What’s in it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6013,An actual real scientist.  How was that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6014,What are you doing?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6015,"Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?",LEONARD,HOWARD
6016,I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.,OTHERS,OTHERS

6022,"Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6023,What does that mean?,RAJ,LEONARD
6024,"Okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6025,Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6026,You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.,PENNY,HOWARD
6027,"Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!",OTHERS,HOWARD
6028,"Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.",HOWARD,RAJ
6029,And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6030,All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…,SHELDON,SHELDON
6031,It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.,LEONARD,LEONARD

6042,"Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6043,"Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6044,"Okay, what is going on?",OTHERS,PENNY
6045,I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6046,"Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?",RAJ,HOWARD
6047,You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6048,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD

6053,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
6054,I don’t want to do that.,RAJ,LEONARD
6055,"This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.",SHELDON,RAJ
6056,"Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?",LEONARD,PENNY
6057,"Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.",SHELDON,SHELDON

6194,How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.,SHELDON,RAJ
6195,"As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes.",RAJ,SHELDON
6196,"Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6197,Why would you do that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6198,"Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6199,That’s so sweet.,PENNY,OTHERS
6200,I told you it was Penny.,OTHERS,SHELDON

6203,"Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?",PENNY,PENNY
6204,What am I doing?,PENNY,SHELDON
6205,Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6206,Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6207,Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.,RAJ,OTHERS
6208,That was great. Rub my chest again.,OTHERS,OTHERS
6209,"I’m sorry, 294?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6210,"Sheldon, you got a minute?",LEONARD,PENNY
6211,Oh dear Lord. No!,SHELDON,SHELDON
6212,"No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I’m allergic to peanuts.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6213,"Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6214,"Here, buy this one. Look, it’s the one we’re getting, see, happy guy available.",PENNY,PENNY
6215,You do that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6216,There’s a chance.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6217,"Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I’ll have sex with him.",RAJ,SHELDON
6218,"I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6219,"No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker.",SHELDON,HOWARD
6220,And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6221,Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!,PENNY,HOWARD
6222,"I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6223,"It’s not soup, it’s courage.",PENNY,SHELDON
6224,You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6225,"Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6226,I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6227,Does that mean the relationship is over?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6228,I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6229,"Whoa, where is that coming from?",HOWARD,PENNY
6230,"No, you just suck at teaching.",PENNY,PENNY
6231,"I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6232,"Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…",HOWARD,SHELDON
6233,Of course.,PENNY,SHELDON
6234,"Ah, You guys are the best.",PENNY,PENNY

6236,I think her weekend just opened up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6237,Never mind. I got it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6238,"Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6239,Right. And which one do I want?,SHELDON,PENNY
6240,What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6241,"Oh, really? So how did I do it?",HOWARD,PENNY
6242,We just broke up.,PENNY,LEONARD
6243,"Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6244,That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6245,"No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6246,"Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6247,"You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6248,Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?,HOWARD,HOWARD
6249,"Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.",LEONARD,PENNY
6250,Come.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6251,It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6252,Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6253,"When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6254,"What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!",SHELDON,SHELDON
6255,"Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.",RAJ,RAJ
6256,"All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6257,"Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6258,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
6259,Sounds like a plan.,RAJ,LEONARD
6260,What’d you get? What’d you get?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6261,It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6262,"Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.",LEONARD,RAJ
6263,"Oh, no, he’s drinking it.",SHELDON,PENNY
6264,Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?,HOWARD,SHELDON
6265,Yes.,RAJ,LEONARD
6266,"I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6267,"I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.",RAJ,LEONARD
6268,"It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6269,"My apologies Leonard, I’m only as good as my teacher.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6270,"It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6271,"You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6272,Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.,LEONARD,RAJ
6273,Because I’m the one who had it towed.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6274,"Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.",LEONARD,RAJ
6275,"I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6276,"Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.",SHELDON,RAJ
6277,"You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?",PENNY,PENNY
6278,What? Us? Who else knows?,HOWARD,LEONARD
6279,"Oh, yeah? How’s that?",HOWARD,PENNY
6280,"Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.",LEONARD,PENNY
6281,Who’s involved?,OTHERS,SHELDON
6282,Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?,PENNY,SHELDON
6283,And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.,HOWARD,OTHERS
6284,Killed by badger.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6285,"I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6286,"Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6287,"Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6288,"I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6289,What happened?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6290,Okay. We are reading that right now.,PENNY,PENNY
6291,Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?,LEONARD,PENNY
6292,"Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6293,"All right, what’s going on?",PENNY,PENNY
6294,Is that a relevant factor?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6295,"Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.",OTHERS,PENNY
6296,Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6297,Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6298,"Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6299,"Ugh. Me, too. What happened?",HOWARD,PENNY
6300,"The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6301,You’re being childish.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6302,"Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6303,How teeny tiny?,LEONARD,HOWARD
6304,The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.,SHELDON,HOWARD
6305,Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.,SHELDON,RAJ
6306,"No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?",RAJ,HOWARD
6307,Here.,LEONARD,SHELDON

6311,"Kiss her, you brilliant fool.",OTHERS,HOWARD
6312,"In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6313,"Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I’ll be Coop. He’ll be Wheels. If he’s okay with that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6314,"It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6315,"Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those.",SHELDON,SHELDON

6317,Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!,RAJ,RAJ

6324,But what if I’m wrong?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6325,"Wow, that’s heavy.",RAJ,PENNY

6361,True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6362,"Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.",SHELDON,SHELDON

6459,I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6460,"Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.",PENNY,LEONARD
6461,"No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?",OTHERS,PENNY
6462,"Well, we sure saw that coming.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6463,What is it?,PENNY,LEONARD
6464,"Howard, sit down.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6465,I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.,SHELDON,OTHERS

6469,Have I crossed some sort of line again?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6470,"I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6471,"Good night, puny human!.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6472,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6473,"And I’m happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6474,"And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6475,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6476,"And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6477,"Get out of here, Barry.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6478,"Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?",OTHERS,PENNY
6479,"Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl.",RAJ,RAJ
6480,"No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.",RAJ,RAJ
6481,"Okay, if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it.",PENNY,PENNY
6482,Nothing.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6483,"Okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.",PENNY,PENNY
6484,You ready to go?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6485,Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6486,Sounds like a lot of work.,RAJ,LEONARD
6487,Lava serpent.,RAJ,SHELDON
6488,"Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.",RAJ,PENNY
6489,"Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6490,You’re an even better husband.,PENNY,OTHERS
6491,I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6492,I’m sorry. That I asked.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6493,That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?,OTHERS,OTHERS
6494,"All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6495,Come on. It’ll be fun.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6496,We’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6497,"Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6498,You’re gonna want to take these with food.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6499,You’re still awake?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6500,"You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6501,"Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.",RAJ,SHELDON
6502,I hear a woman’s voice.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6503,"Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.",PENNY,SHELDON
6504,"No, I got it.",RAJ,LEONARD
6505,"Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?",RAJ,PENNY
6506,Thanks Penny.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6507,Is that Steve Wozniak?,HOWARD,SHELDON
6508,I get it. I haven’t even made it to my office yet.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6509,My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6510,‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6511,"You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6512,"This is weird, right?",LEONARD,PENNY
6513,You want some Oreos?,LEONARD,HOWARD
6514,"Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?",PENNY,PENNY
6515,Yeah.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6516,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6517,"Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.",PENNY,PENNY
6518,"No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.",RAJ,SHELDON
6519,It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6520,That’s not helpful.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6521,You need sleep.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6522,"You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good about us.",OTHERS,PENNY
6523,What did I do?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6524,To send a message. She is not for you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6525,Yeah.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6526,What are you implying?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6527,"No, not at all.",RAJ,SHELDON
6528,"Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?",PENNY,PENNY
6529,I’ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don’t do the exact same thing?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6530,I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6531,"Okay, well, I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit.",PENNY,PENNY
6532,"Oh, hey.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6533,What kind of cake do you like?,OTHERS,OTHERS

6539,"…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.",OTHERS,RAJ
6540,"Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6541,"Yes, I did.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6542,"Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6543,What are you doing?,PENNY,SHELDON
6544,"I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.",HOWARD,HOWARD
6545,"This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6546,"Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6547,But you don’t even understand its symbolism.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6548,I’m sorry you had to go through that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6549,"No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6550,"Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.",PENNY,SHELDON
6551,My fault. I brought him up.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6552,"I’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it.",RAJ,RAJ
6553,And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6554,I guess.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6555,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6556,"Yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.",HOWARD,PENNY
6557,I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6558,"You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6559,"Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly.",HOWARD,PENNY
6560,You tell me.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6561,It’s you! I touched you!,OTHERS,SHELDON
6562,"I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I’m not.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6563,"Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.",PENNY,PENNY
6564,"Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6565,"No, I don’t drink coffee.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6566,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6567,"Oh, God.",PENNY,PENNY
6568,"I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6569,"Well, didn’t think this is where my life would be.",RAJ,SHELDON
6570,"Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.",PENNY,PENNY
6571,"Hey, there’s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don’t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6572,Original.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6573,"Uh, yeah.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6574,You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.,HOWARD,RAJ

6576,"No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6577,Nah.,PENNY,LEONARD
6578,Nobody has a disease!,HOWARD,SHELDON
6579,"Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.",SHELDON,RAJ
6580,I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception.,RAJ,SHELDON
6581,"Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6582,And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6583,"Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?",HOWARD,SHELDON
6584,"Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6585,"Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.",OTHERS,RAJ
6586,Aristotle?,PENNY,SHELDON
6587,No kidding?,LEONARD,LEONARD

6589,"If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.",LEONARD,OTHERS
6590,Brilliant.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6591,"Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.",HOWARD,RAJ
6592,"No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6593,"No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.",PENNY,PENNY
6594,You want me to stop reading?,PENNY,SHELDON
6595,"Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6596,"I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.",PENNY,SHELDON
6597,"It would, wouldn’t it?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6598,What if I dump you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6599,"I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…",HOWARD,LEONARD
6600,You should’ve seen your face.,RAJ,SHELDON
6601,And we all thank you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6602,Like what?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6603,"Oh, that’s pretty steep.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6604,Thank you.,RAJ,SHELDON
6605,Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6606,I think he might be learning on his own.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6607,"All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.",PENNY,PENNY
6608,You might want to pace yourself.,PENNY,SHELDON
6609,"Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?",HOWARD,HOWARD
6610,How about we just talk?,PENNY,LEONARD
6611,"Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!",LEONARD,PENNY
6612,Why?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6613,"This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.",SHELDON,RAJ
6614,"The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6615,"Okay, that sounds good.",RAJ,PENNY
6616,What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6617,"Well, if you honestly…",OTHERS,PENNY
6618,I know that face. That’s your propose face.,PENNY,SHELDON
6619,"Yeah, beam me up. I love it.",PENNY,HOWARD

6621,"I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6622,Maybe. We enter the dungeon.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6623,Uh..,HOWARD,LEONARD
6624,A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6625,I do.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6626,And my cousin’s a lawyer.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6627,"Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6628,I’m over it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6629,"Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6630,I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6631,"Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6632,"Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.",PENNY,PENNY
6633,"Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6634,Don’t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6635,Tell him he sounds like that.,HOWARD,PENNY
6636,Nice shot.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6637,I’m not unhappy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6638,No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6639,You think?,HOWARD,LEONARD
6640,Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6641,You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.,OTHERS,HOWARD
6642,Did she have a middle name?,OTHERS,SHELDON
6643,How thoughtful.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6644,"Okay, have a safe trip.",PENNY,PENNY
6645,Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6646,"Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6647,"Come on, I’ll help you pick something.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6648,We went to the comic book store last night.,RAJ,LEONARD
6649,"Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.",HOWARD,PENNY
6650,"What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?",OTHERS,LEONARD
6651,"I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!",LEONARD,HOWARD
6652,Sorry.,PENNY,LEONARD
6653,Who else would it be?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6654,"You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6655,Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6656,Was that sarcasm?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6657,"Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?",PENNY,SHELDON
6658,"Well, I actually might be able to help.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6659,"Yeah, sure, I guess.",PENNY,LEONARD
6660,"Nope, all good.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6661,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6662,"When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?",HOWARD,HOWARD
6663,"I mean, it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6664,"Oh, hey.",PENNY,LEONARD
6665,"Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.",PENNY,SHELDON
6666,It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put Meemaw in a home!,SHELDON,SHELDON
6667,I think I live here now. It’s fine.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6668,I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6669,Whatever.,RAJ,LEONARD

6674,"Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6675,I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.,PENNY,PENNY
6676,It took you four years to get through High School?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6677,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
6678,"No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6679,"Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.",PENNY,SHELDON
6680,"Oh, then, I think you’ll appreciate what I got you.",LEONARD,PENNY
6681,"Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?",PENNY,PENNY
6682,You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6683,Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.,HOWARD,SHELDON

6685,"You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway.",OTHERS,HOWARD
6686,Prove it.,LEONARD,LEONARD

6696,And who was that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6697,What do we owe you?,HOWARD,LEONARD
6698,I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry.,SHELDON,OTHERS
6699,"I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.",SHELDON,OTHERS
6700,"Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?",PENNY,PENNY
6701,I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.,OTHERS,OTHERS
6702,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6703,"Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?",HOWARD,PENNY
6704,You robbed me of my greatest achievement.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6705,That’s all?,PENNY,LEONARD
6706,"Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6707,"It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.",RAJ,RAJ

6717,"Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6718,"Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6719,"I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6720,It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.,PENNY,PENNY
6721,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6722,"Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?",RAJ,SHELDON
6723,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6724,"Well, is it or isn’t it?",PENNY,PENNY
6725,"Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that.",SHELDON,SHELDON

6742,Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6743,"So, is it serious, do you like her?",PENNY,PENNY
6744,Right. Still mad at me about that?,PENNY,LEONARD
6745,"Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6746,What about the ones in the corner?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6747,"No, I needed to hear it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6748,"I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6749,They call themselves Bozites?,LEONARD,SHELDON

6751,"If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6752,Yo.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6753,Thank you for letting me stay here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6754,What’s wrong?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6755,"Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6756,"Um, tomorrow?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6757,"Oh, Zack. Hey.",PENNY,PENNY
6758,Good one.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6759,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6760,"Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6761,"No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6762,Leonard.,PENNY,SHELDON
6763,"Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6764,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6765,"This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.",OTHERS,HOWARD
6766,"Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6767,"Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.",SHELDON,PENNY
6768,This is it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6769,"Hmmph, wrong.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6770,"Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6771,Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6772,"Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why.",PENNY,SHELDON
6773,"I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.",HOWARD,HOWARD
6774,"Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.",SHELDON,PENNY
6775,Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?,HOWARD,SHELDON
6776,"Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here.",PENNY,PENNY
6777,"You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6778,Proceed.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6779,Are you okay?,OTHERS,PENNY
6780,Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist.,SHELDON,HOWARD
6781,"Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6782,Oh.,PENNY,PENNY
6783,You’re annoying.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6784,That’s a stupid question.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6785,"I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!",HOWARD,LEONARD
6786,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
6787,"Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6788,They always look. It never ends well.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6789,"Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6790,Wackadoodle.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6791,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
6792,You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6793,"Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6794,"Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6795,That I have coitus with her.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6796,"No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6797,You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.,SHELDON,RAJ
6798,Hello.,RAJ,SHELDON
6799,"Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.",SHELDON,PENNY
6800,That’s weird.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6801,"Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6802,Absolutely not.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6803,It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6804,Brobdingnagian.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6805,"Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.",PENNY,SHELDON
6806,I am.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6807,No need. Penny and I are very close.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6808,Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6809,"Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.",SHELDON,HOWARD
6810,I could not ask you to do that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6811,All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6812,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6813,"Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.",RAJ,PENNY
6814,"All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6815,"You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.",RAJ,LEONARD
6816,Why are you telling me about my own culture?,RAJ,SHELDON
6817,It’s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6818,"Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?",RAJ,PENNY
6819,Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6820,Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.,PENNY,LEONARD
6821,"Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?",LEONARD,PENNY
6822,"Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6823,I knew it! What do I do?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6824,"What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?",OTHERS,HOWARD
6825,"Well, I do appreciate you working on this.",OTHERS,LEONARD

6830,It’s amazing.,LEONARD,OTHERS
6831,You’re kidding.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6832,"I’m not letting go, you let go.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6833,So did you get to talk to Penny?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6834,"If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask.",RAJ,OTHERS
6835,"Me, too. Good times.",RAJ,OTHERS
6836,I was using the bathroom.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6837,These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6838,Why aren’t you talking to me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6839,Just don’t smoke.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6840,"Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream.",LEONARD,RAJ
6841,"Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.",RAJ,SHELDON
6842,"Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.",HOWARD,RAJ
6843,"I can’t take it, dude.",RAJ,RAJ
6844,Excellent choice.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6845,"You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6846,"Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work, right?",RAJ,HOWARD
6847,"I just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6848,"Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?",PENNY,HOWARD
6849,All righty. What’s new?,PENNY,PENNY
6850,No. You’re crazy about me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6851,"Hey, you got a minute?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6852,"Placebo, you say. Interesting.",HOWARD,RAJ
6853,"No, regular.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6854,Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.,PENNY,HOWARD
6855,I just gave you a reasonable explanation.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6856,Do you really think you should be drinking right now?,HOWARD,PENNY
6857,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
6858,I don’t want to talk about it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6859,"Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6860,"Raj and I entered Sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.",HOWARD,OTHERS
6861,"I, I didn’t want to interrupt.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6862,Now you’re just being ridiculous.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6863,Aaargh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6864,I said I needed time to think.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6865,"Well, you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard.",PENNY,PENNY
6866,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6867,"I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6868,"Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6869,"Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6870,Homesick is a type of being sick.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6871,"Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6872,Fair enough. When’s your break?,HOWARD,SHELDON
6873,"Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend.",PENNY,PENNY
6874,"I’m sorry. Uh, this one. Let’s go!",HOWARD,LEONARD
6875,"No, thanks. I’m good.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6876,I still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You’re a young man.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6877,"It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6878,Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.,RAJ,PENNY
6879,"Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6880,Is that true?,RAJ,LEONARD
6881,Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.,SHELDON,HOWARD
6882,"I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6883,"Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.",HOWARD,HOWARD
6884,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
6885,I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6886,"Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.",LEONARD,PENNY
6887,Really? That’s impressive.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6888,"It’s, it’s not working, dude.",RAJ,RAJ
6889,Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6890,Good. This is exciting.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6891,I don’t want to talk about it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6892,"Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.",RAJ,HOWARD
6893,"Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.",PENNY,PENNY
6894,Wait! Penny! Take me with you!,LEONARD,SHELDON
6895,Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.,RAJ,SHELDON
6896,"Later, dude.",RAJ,RAJ
6897,Did you go to your prom?,RAJ,SHELDON
6898,Really?,PENNY,LEONARD
6899,Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6900,"Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6901,It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6902,You don’t know we’re wrong yet.,RAJ,LEONARD
6903,Damn his Vulcan hearing.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6904,"Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6905,"Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6906,And now we’ll never know.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6907,"Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6908,"Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6909,"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6910,50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.,OTHERS,HOWARD
6911,"No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?",OTHERS,PENNY
6912,I can’t think of a reason why not.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6913,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too.",PENNY,HOWARD
6914,"Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6915,"So, how was your day?",SHELDON,LEONARD
6916,Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.,LEONARD,PENNY
6917,"Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.",RAJ,RAJ
6918,"No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.",RAJ,SHELDON
6919,"Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6920,"As a rule, no.",PENNY,SHELDON
6921,Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.,PENNY,SHELDON
6922,What are you gonna say?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6923,Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?,LEONARD,OTHERS
6924,I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6925,You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6926,What does she think I am?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6927,I have.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6928,Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6929,"Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6930,"Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places.",RAJ,PENNY
6931,"Hi, Stuart.",OTHERS,OTHERS
6932,"Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.",OTHERS,RAJ
6933,Maybe I will.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6934,"Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.",SHELDON,PENNY
6935,Don’t know.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6936,That was a good one.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6937,What’s going on?,HOWARD,LEONARD
6938,"Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6939,You may have actually just come up with something.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6940,I’m David Underhill.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6941,"What’s wrong with me, Penny?",RAJ,LEONARD
6942,"In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6943,Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6944,Yeah.,RAJ,LEONARD
6945,I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.,LEONARD,RAJ
6946,"Yeah, hey, buddy.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6947,"So, are we ready to order?",PENNY,PENNY
6948,"Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist.",HOWARD,OTHERS
6949,"That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6950,"Fancy a dip, my dear?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6951,"No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?",RAJ,RAJ
6952,You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6953,Leonard?,PENNY,SHELDON
6954,"Yes. Uh, welcome back.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6955,"You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?",HOWARD,SHELDON
6956,"Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6957,What if I get caught?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6958,"Nice to meet you, Bethany.",HOWARD,OTHERS
6959,Really uncomfortable.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6960,That’s not even from your franchise!,SHELDON,LEONARD
6961,We’re not wasting time with names right now.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6962,"That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6963,Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?,PENNY,SHELDON
6964,"No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.",LEONARD,HOWARD
6965,"Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.",PENNY,SHELDON
6966,"Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6967,"Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.",HOWARD,RAJ
6968,Screw it. I’ll go later.,PENNY,LEONARD
6969,Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?,PENNY,HOWARD
6970,"I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. I’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!",SHELDON,SHELDON
6971,"Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.",LEONARD,PENNY
6972,"Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.",PENNY,PENNY
6973,I don’t drink coffee.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6974,"Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6975,"I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6976,Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.,RAJ,HOWARD
6977,"No, it’s okay.",PENNY,PENNY
6978,"Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.",RAJ,RAJ
6979,"We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6980,Smoother than you.,PENNY,SHELDON
6981,"Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here.",OTHERS,PENNY
6982,"We, we’re thinking, two years.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6983,"Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?",RAJ,LEONARD
6984,It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.,LEONARD,RAJ
6985,Eight for 28.,RAJ,SHELDON
6986,"Yes, ma’am.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6987,That’s true.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6988,"No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.",LEONARD,HOWARD
6989,"I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6990,Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?,HOWARD,HOWARD
6991,"I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6992,"Yeah, are you ready for this?",OTHERS,PENNY
6993,"Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.",RAJ,LEONARD
6994,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6995,"Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.",SHELDON,OTHERS
6996,"For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6997,"Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?",PENNY,SHELDON
6998,"Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.",HOWARD,PENNY
6999,"Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7000,"Sorry I’m late, I’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.",HOWARD,HOWARD
7001,"I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.",LEONARD,OTHERS
7002,"No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7003,"Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!",SHELDON,SHELDON
7004,Control issues?,PENNY,SHELDON
7005,"Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7006,"Okay, what just happened?",PENNY,PENNY
7007,Sounds good.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7008,"Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7009,Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.,PENNY,PENNY
7010,"Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7011,Hi.,PENNY,PENNY
7012,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7013,"That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.",HOWARD,HOWARD
7014,They didn’t say.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7015,"Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?",RAJ,HOWARD
7016,"I know, but…",LEONARD,LEONARD
7017,"No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7018,"Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7019,There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7020,"Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.",SHELDON,PENNY
7021,That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7022,"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7023,You do? You’re not messing with me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7024,No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7025,"Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.",OTHERS,LEONARD

7324,"Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7325,I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7326,Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7327,"Okay, here’s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won’t know which, I’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink.",PENNY,PENNY
7328,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7329,Uganda.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7330,And now the movie just got rated R.,HOWARD,RAJ
7331,"It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7332,Is someone sick?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7333,You want an acting lesson?,PENNY,PENNY
7334,"Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…",PENNY,SHELDON
7335,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7336,Your guy Eddie Crispo?,RAJ,HOWARD
7337,"Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7338,"Yeah, but you were neither.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7339,"Right. Ah! Where’s the lime?  Oh, okay, we’re sharing.",LEONARD,PENNY
7340,"I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7341,Who’s ready for a wedding?,OTHERS,OTHERS
7342,Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7343,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?",HOWARD,PENNY
7344,"Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7345,There have been studies.,SHELDON,OTHERS
7346,Thank you for captioning my nightmare.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7347,"Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.",PENNY,PENNY
7348,"Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically.",PENNY,SHELDON
7349,"And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!",RAJ,PENNY
7350,"Yeah, I was joking.",HOWARD,PENNY
7351,Which side do you come down on?,HOWARD,SHELDON
7352,Okay. What does it say I’m feeling?,OTHERS,PENNY
7353,And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7354,"Great. And afterward, I’ll take you all out for Chinese.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7355,Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7356,"I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.",RAJ,PENNY
7357,All right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7358,Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.,SHELDON,SHELDON

7360,So?,LEONARD,LEONARD

7366,I’m going to talk anyway.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7367,He can feel sadness?,HOWARD,OTHERS
7368,"It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7369,"Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.",RAJ,RAJ
7370,"I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7371,"Black case, top compartment.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7372,Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7373,"Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.",PENNY,LEONARD
7374,Absolutely not.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7375,Forget it.,PENNY,LEONARD
7376,What kind of teenager did you think I was?,PENNY,OTHERS
7377,"So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?",PENNY,LEONARD
7378,How about something a little more realistic?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7379,Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7380,That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7381,"Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.",OTHERS,OTHERS
7382,Hey.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7383,"Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.",OTHERS,PENNY
7384,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7385,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7386,"No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking.",HOWARD,LEONARD

7389,I was otherwise engaged.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7390,Did he take the T-shirt to space?,OTHERS,HOWARD
7391,Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7392,"Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.",RAJ,PENNY

7394,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7395,The Wesley Crushers?,PENNY,SHELDON
7396,Oh.,PENNY,PENNY
7397,Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!,SHELDON,SHELDON
7398,More and more sure.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7399,"Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7400,"Don’t patronise me, just get the sword.",PENNY,SHELDON
7401,"But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.",RAJ,SHELDON
7402,"But after months of struggling, I’m finally making progress.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7403,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7404,And Albert Einstein?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7405,"Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.",PENNY,LEONARD
7406,"I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…",SHELDON,SHELDON
7407,"Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.",PENNY,PENNY
7408,You could try saying that without smiling.,RAJ,LEONARD
7409,"Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?",PENNY,LEONARD
7410,"Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?",OTHERS,OTHERS
7411,You’re so close.,SHELDON,OTHERS
7412,"No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.",HOWARD,HOWARD
7413,"I did this for free, let me get a little something.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7414,That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7415,"Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.",PENNY,PENNY
7416,"Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7417,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7418,"Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?",RAJ,SHELDON
7419,"Good, good.",PENNY,LEONARD
7420,They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7421,"Oy gevalt, you’re hot.",OTHERS,HOWARD
7422,"Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7423,"Oh, me, too.",PENNY,OTHERS
7424,"Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7425,What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7426,It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7427,"Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7428,"Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7429,"Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7430,Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.,PENNY,SHELDON
7431,"No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.",LEONARD,PENNY
7432,"You were, but somehow I held myself back.",PENNY,SHELDON
7433,"Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense.",RAJ,LEONARD
7434,"Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.",PENNY,PENNY
7435,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7436,I’ll tell you later.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7437,"No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to.",OTHERS,PENNY
7438,I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.,OTHERS,RAJ
7439,So anyway  Hello.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7440,Yeah?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7441,"Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.",OTHERS,OTHERS
7442,It depends on what Bus you have.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7443,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7444,"Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7445,"What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7446,"So you’re a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you’re still winning.",RAJ,SHELDON
7447,Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7448,"I swear, I am on your side.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7449,"No, there was no spat.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7450,"Okay, I know what I’m going to do.",RAJ,PENNY
7451,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.",RAJ,HOWARD
7452,I would take that deal all day long.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7453,"Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.",HOWARD,PENNY
7454,Right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7455,Another football game?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7456,"Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7457,"Wait a minute, you have a guy?",LEONARD,LEONARD
7458,I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7459,What the hell?,HOWARD,PENNY
7460,"So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7461,"Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7462,Just pour me a drink.,HOWARD,PENNY
7463,Just say thank you.,PENNY,LEONARD
7464,"You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.",RAJ,SHELDON
7465,"So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn’t have to?",OTHERS,HOWARD
7466,Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7467,"Well, good for you.",PENNY,PENNY
7468,"Well, what makes me the weakest member?",OTHERS,SHELDON
7469,What the hell is that?,PENNY,PENNY
7470,"Yeah, sure.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7471,Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7472,"Okay, bye.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7473,I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.,PENNY,LEONARD
7474,"Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?",OTHERS,PENNY
7475,Sure. This is for you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7476,Same here.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7477,I give up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7478,Get out of the way. What are you doing here?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7479,"Yeah, great.",RAJ,LEONARD
7480,Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7481,"It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.",LEONARD,RAJ
7482,"Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do.",RAJ,RAJ
7483,All I said was she seems nice.,LEONARD,OTHERS
7484,"You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7485,Here you go.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7486,So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7487,"You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?",PENNY,PENNY
7488,He makes a valid point.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7489,What makes you say that?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7490,"You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7491,"Wait, I need help getting down.",SHELDON,PENNY
7492,"Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.",PENNY,PENNY
7493,How is that not a braniac?,PENNY,SHELDON
7494,"Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7495,"You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.",OTHERS,RAJ
7496,So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?,PENNY,LEONARD
7497,"Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.",LEONARD,PENNY
7498,"It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7499,Counting this instance? 317.,SHELDON,SHELDON

7501,"There’s no one there. You’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!",HOWARD,HOWARD
7502,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
7503,"Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7504,"When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a while, good night.",LEONARD,RAJ
7505,Don’t.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7506,How shall we begin?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7507,"That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.",LEONARD,PENNY
7508,"And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7509,If I ever actually ever get married.,OTHERS,OTHERS
7510,"When I lost my own father, I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7511,"Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7512,"Oh. Go away, Sheldon.",HOWARD,PENNY
7513,"Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I’m gonna head out.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7514,"Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.",LEONARD,PENNY
7515,"All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7516,"Yeah, you’d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.",RAJ,HOWARD
7517,And you were so good in the TV commercial.,LEONARD,PENNY
7518,Yep.,PENNY,LEONARD
7519,Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?,PENNY,LEONARD
7520,That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7521,Do you have allergies?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7522,It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.,SHELDON,RAJ
7523,"All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7524,Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.,SHELDON,SHELDON

7527,"Whatever you think is best, cutie.",OTHERS,OTHERS
7528,"April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.",SHELDON,RAJ
7529,"I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7530,"Yeah, that’s a toughie.",PENNY,LEONARD
7531,See? Isn’t this better than a hotel room?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7532,That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.,PENNY,LEONARD
7533,"Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7534,"I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7535,"I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.",RAJ,PENNY
7536,Well…,SHELDON,LEONARD
7537,Why?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7538,"It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at.",LEONARD,LEONARD

7546,Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7547,"No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary.",RAJ,PENNY
7548,Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?,LEONARD,PENNY
7549,"If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7550,"Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7551,"The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.",SHELDON,SHELDON

7555,What kind of tea would you like?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7556,I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.,SHELDON,SHELDON

7558,You’re giving me a sticker?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7559,"Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?",LEONARD,HOWARD
7560,"Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.",RAJ,RAJ
7561,No. Steve Patterson told me.,LEONARD,SHELDON

7573,What do you want?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7574,Just answer the phone.,PENNY,LEONARD

7576,"Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?",PENNY,LEONARD
7577,"Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7578,Look at us. What are we doing?,PENNY,LEONARD
7579,She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.,OTHERS,OTHERS

7869,Why don’t we just go into your….,LEONARD,LEONARD
7870,Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7871,"Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7872,Sounds like most of my dates.,LEONARD,RAJ
7873,"No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.",RAJ,SHELDON
7874,Okay.,SHELDON,PENNY
7875,"Yes, there are.",SHELDON,LEONARD

7878,Does it? A happy accident.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7879,Really?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7880,"I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7881,"Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.",HOWARD,SHELDON

7891,And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.,OTHERS,OTHERS

7908,I went to the market with Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON

7918,"Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7919,That’s not how it looks in the picture.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7920,Maybe you’re right.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7921,"Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?",PENNY,PENNY
7922,"Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7923,"Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.",RAJ,LEONARD
7924,"Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.  Oh my God, Sean Penn!",PENNY,RAJ

7926,What’s that?,PENNY,PENNY
7927,Right.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7928,"Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.",OTHERS,HOWARD
7929,Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.,SHELDON,OTHERS

7931,"No, it’s okay.",OTHERS,PENNY
7932,Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.,RAJ,LEONARD
7933,"Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.",RAJ,SHELDON
7934,Leonard.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7935,Don’t sit in his spot.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7936,"Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it.",OTHERS,PENNY
7937,When are you going to talk to him?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7938,"Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?",LEONARD,LEONARD
7939,Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7940,I can’t believe they did that.,LEONARD,PENNY
7941,"You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7942,I don’t need to explain myself to you!,SHELDON,SHELDON
7943,We liked Leonard.,HOWARD,PENNY

7945,No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7946,"Not like a date, a date.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7947,"You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.",OTHERS,HOWARD
7948,That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7949,"Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7950,All right.,PENNY,SHELDON
7951,"Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7952,"Yes, you were!.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7953,Like this?,PENNY,LEONARD
7954,They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.,HOWARD,HOWARD
7955,Good for you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7956,Is the sex starting now?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7957,I’m gonna go check on dinner.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7958,Not now!,HOWARD,LEONARD
7959,"Oh, really. Anybody we know?",OTHERS,PENNY
7960,I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7961,What are you drawing over there?,RAJ,LEONARD
7962,"Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.",SHELDON,SHELDON

7976,"Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?",PENNY,PENNY
7977,What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?,PENNY,LEONARD
7978,I can’t get the damned key out.,PENNY,HOWARD
7979,"No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7980,"It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7981,"Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?",RAJ,LEONARD
7982,Oh. Did not know that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7983,"I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7984,Done?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7985,What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.,OTHERS,HOWARD
7986,"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7987,"Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking.",PENNY,OTHERS
7988,Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7989,That did not clear things up.,PENNY,SHELDON
7990,"Yes, quite the kerfuffle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7991,"If I could of, I would of.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7992,"Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7993,Here you go.,RAJ,LEONARD

7997,You put moths in my food?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7998,Got it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7999,"Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.",OTHERS,PENNY
8000,So what did you and Leonard do?,HOWARD,PENNY
8001,And it’s gone.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8002,"I do, too, but there’s not.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8003,That’s true.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8004,I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.,OTHERS,OTHERS

8012,That’s right.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8013,"Yes, Penny plays for me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8014,What did he say?,SHELDON,LEONARD
8015,Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.,OTHERS,PENNY
8016,"No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8017,"Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.",RAJ,RAJ
8018,"Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8019,"Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore.",PENNY,PENNY
8020,Did you have a nice time?,SHELDON,OTHERS
8021,"Stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8022,Not with commentary.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8023,"It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?",HOWARD,OTHERS
8024,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8025,"That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court.",PENNY,HOWARD
8026,"I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.",OTHERS,SHELDON

8028,"Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.",RAJ,SHELDON
8029,"Great, how?",PENNY,PENNY
8030,"Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8031,"Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8032,Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8033,"Fine. Just hold on. Mommy’s on the phone! Sorry. We’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.",OTHERS,RAJ
8034,You’re a dentist.,HOWARD,OTHERS
8035,"Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.",PENNY,PENNY
8036,"I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8037,"You know what? I hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8038,"What do you want, Sheldon?",RAJ,LEONARD
8039,Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8040,Doing laundry?,PENNY,SHELDON
8041,You should know I had nothing to do with that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8042,These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.,RAJ,SHELDON

8044,That’s just wrong.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8045,Aw.,SHELDON,PENNY
8046,I am.,HOWARD,SHELDON

8048,"Oh, what a jerk.",PENNY,PENNY
8049,Again?,PENNY,SHELDON
8050,What kind of guys did you used to go out with?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8051,"I don’t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you’re not ready to move on.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8052,"Oh, I’d watch that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8053,"You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.",PENNY,PENNY
8054,I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.,LEONARD,OTHERS
8055,Hmm?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8056,Are you fun in any of them?,PENNY,LEONARD
8057,"Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.",RAJ,RAJ
8058,"Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8059,"Penny, how’s it going over there?",RAJ,LEONARD
8060,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
8061,"Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?",OTHERS,RAJ
8062,It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8063,"You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.",RAJ,RAJ
8064,"No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing.",SHELDON,SHELDON

8071,What’s this button do?,RAJ,LEONARD
8072,"Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.",LEONARD,PENNY
8073,Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.,HOWARD,SHELDON

8075,"No, no. I’m going out like this.",HOWARD,PENNY
8076,"Fine, you drink it.",RAJ,SHELDON
8077,Howard Wolowitz?,RAJ,SHELDON

8079,Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8080,What brought this on?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8081,What are you guys talking about?,PENNY,LEONARD
8082,"No, don’t do that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8083,"Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8084,"Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…",SHELDON,SHELDON
8085,"That’s not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?",SHELDON,LEONARD

8087,"Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her.",RAJ,LEONARD

8089,"Now, who would do that?",SHELDON,SHELDON
8090,The fires of Mount Doom?,RAJ,SHELDON
8091,"So, we need to talk.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8092,"Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8093,Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?,LEONARD,OTHERS
8094,I’m out.,LEONARD,SHELDON

8104,"No, I could’ve done more.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8105,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",LEONARD,PENNY
8106,And you live here for free.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8107,They’re not saying that.,PENNY,LEONARD

8109,"Thank you. Okay, I’m gonna try and get some work done.",OTHERS,PENNY
8110,"All right, you can suck it in a little bit.",HOWARD,PENNY

8116,Said the Grinch to Christmas.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8117,How are we doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8118,Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8119,"Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable.",RAJ,PENNY
8120,Is it really that high?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8121,"Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8122,"Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8123,"No, I can’t.",PENNY,LEONARD

8134,"Well, whose fault was that?",OTHERS,SHELDON
8135,"Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?",LEONARD,PENNY
8136,So we get to have a scene with him?,SHELDON,LEONARD
8137,Outweigh the needs of the few.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8138,At least they don’t know it was you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8139,"Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?",OTHERS,PENNY

8422,"Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.",PENNY,PENNY
8423,"It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.",HOWARD,RAJ
8424,"Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.",RAJ,RAJ
8425,"Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.",OTHERS,PENNY
8426,"Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.",HOWARD,PENNY
8427,"Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about.",SHELDON,OTHERS
8428,"Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don’t think I need any more advice.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8429,I have to go to the bathroom.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8430,Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.,OTHERS,SHELDON
8431,"Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.",SHELDON,RAJ
8432,"No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8433,What are you guys up to?,RAJ,LEONARD

8439,"Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.",RAJ,PENNY
8440,I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8441,You really think so?,RAJ,LEONARD
8442,"When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.",HOWARD,HOWARD
8443,"Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8444,"Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting.",SHELDON,PENNY
8445,Six thirty.,PENNY,LEONARD
8446,"Boy, I wish I could say no.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8447,"Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?",SHELDON,SHELDON
8448,Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.,LEONARD,HOWARD
8449,I killed his Chewbacca slippers.,LEONARD,HOWARD
8450,"No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8451,"I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.",LEONARD,PENNY
8452,You okay?,OTHERS,PENNY
8453,"That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.",PENNY,HOWARD
8454,Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8455,"Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8456,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD

8458,"What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.",OTHERS,HOWARD
8459,Fire away.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8460,"With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?",LEONARD,RAJ
8461,So you’ll talk to him?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8462,"That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.",RAJ,SHELDON
8463,"Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.",HOWARD,HOWARD
8464,"That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.",RAJ,RAJ
8465,"Yeah, sure, I guess.",PENNY,LEONARD
8466,"It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8467,"Bye, buddy!",RAJ,LEONARD
8468,Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….,LEONARD,SHELDON
8469,"Oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?",PENNY,PENNY
8470,Nice to meet you.,PENNY,OTHERS
8471,"Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.",LEONARD,PENNY
8472,"Told you, not funny.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8473,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8474,"Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8475,"Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right?  Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.",PENNY,PENNY
8476,"While I’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.",RAJ,SHELDON
8477,"Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?",LEONARD,LEONARD
8478,"Jeepers, I’m drunk.",SHELDON,HOWARD
8479,"Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it.  Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!",PENNY,PENNY
8480,"Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.",OTHERS,PENNY
8481,Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?,OTHERS,SHELDON
8482,Ooh!,OTHERS,OTHERS
8483,"Knock, knock.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8484,"Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?",OTHERS,RAJ
8485,"Oh, what the hell.",LEONARD,PENNY
8486,"No, just focused on work and the church.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8487,"Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister.",LEONARD,PENNY
8488,Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?,PENNY,PENNY
8489,"Me, too.",LEONARD,OTHERS
8490,What was that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
8491,"Love you, too.",PENNY,OTHERS
8492,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8493,Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.,PENNY,HOWARD
8494,You were okay with that?,PENNY,LEONARD
8495,"Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.",RAJ,HOWARD
8496,Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.,OTHERS,OTHERS
8497,"Sheldon, don’t be silly.",OTHERS,PENNY
8498,"In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?",PENNY,LEONARD
8499,"No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8500,Really? Why would you say that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8501,"Yes, but, only to clean.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8502,"So, what are you thinking for dinner?",PENNY,PENNY
8503,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
8504,"Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?",LEONARD,SHELDON
8505,More or less.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8506,The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.,OTHERS,OTHERS
8507,"Oh, please shut up.",HOWARD,PENNY
8508,"Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.",LEONARD,RAJ
8509,"No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.",PENNY,LEONARD
8510,"Oh, wow, that’s so sweet. Hey, what’s this?",PENNY,PENNY
8511,So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.,HOWARD,LEONARD
8512,"Well, it’s not what I want to do.",PENNY,PENNY
8513,"Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.",HOWARD,RAJ
8514,Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.,HOWARD,RAJ
8515,"Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.",SHELDON,PENNY
8516,Hit that thang.,HOWARD,HOWARD
8517,"Yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.",LEONARD,PENNY
8518,"And we live here, so we have no choice.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8519,"OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8520,"One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it.",SHELDON,SHELDON

8522,"Yeah, there is.",PENNY,LEONARD
8523,"What about you, have you been seeing anybody?",OTHERS,LEONARD
8524,"What, you’re not my mother.",SHELDON,HOWARD

8526,Who died and made you king of moments?,RAJ,SHELDON
8527,Okay. Don’t really know where we go from here.,OTHERS,PENNY
8528,"And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8529,"Yeah, that scares me, too.",LEONARD,PENNY
8530,‘Sup?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8531,I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.,LEONARD,LEONARD

8533,Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.,HOWARD,OTHERS
8534,"Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?",LEONARD,LEONARD
8535,"Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8536,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8537,"Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8538,And you just assume you’re always right?,HOWARD,SHELDON
8539,There’s a can in the fridge.,PENNY,PENNY
8540,Are you planning on sitting here?,PENNY,SHELDON
8541,"Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.",HOWARD,PENNY
8542,How about an acetylene torch?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8543,"In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.",RAJ,LEONARD
8544,What did he say?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8545,"Howie, what happened to you?",OTHERS,OTHERS
8546,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY

8550,"So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?",RAJ,PENNY
8551,"Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?",RAJ,SHELDON
8552,Pretty good.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8553,"Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.",OTHERS,OTHERS
8554,"Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?",LEONARD,PENNY
8555,Doesn’t count.,RAJ,LEONARD
8556,What?,SHELDON,LEONARD
8557,"Aw, hell, I miss him.",LEONARD,PENNY

8567,Cleaning up is not young and fun.,PENNY,OTHERS
8568,You mean like Salt Lake City?,SHELDON,RAJ

8571,"Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.",LEONARD,HOWARD

8573,Aren’t you going to check your messages?,SHELDON,SHELDON

8582,I would love to see your collection.,RAJ,OTHERS
8583,"Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8584,Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?,OTHERS,SHELDON

8588,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
8589,How wasted am I?,RAJ,SHELDON
8590,Are you still dating that dermatologist?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8591,"Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.",OTHERS,SHELDON

8593,Couldn’t hurt.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8594,"Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",LEONARD,HOWARD

8600,You pick plenty of movies.,PENNY,LEONARD
8601,"Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8602,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8603,I bet you’d like a drink right now.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8604,Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?,SHELDON,SHELDON

8606,My pleasure. Have a nice night.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8607,Black it is.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8608,"Hey, put your tie back in your pants.",HOWARD,PENNY

8618,"Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!",SHELDON,LEONARD
8619,"What do you mean, not again?",RAJ,LEONARD

8644,What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.,PENNY,LEONARD
8645,"Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.",PENNY,PENNY
8646,"The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.",HOWARD,HOWARD

8667,Sweet. It’s a date.,OTHERS,OTHERS
8668,"Please pester her. Please, for me.",LEONARD,SHELDON

8670,"Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it’s time to cut bait.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8671,"Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.",SHELDON,HOWARD
8672,The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.,SHELDON,SHELDON

8774,"So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you.

8831,"It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.",OTHERS,OTHERS

8835,Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent.,HOWARD,OTHERS

8845,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
8846,You should get one.,OTHERS,LEONARD

8894,"At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8895,The housekeeper does the shopping.,RAJ,SHELDON
8896,What ring?,PENNY,LEONARD
8897,"No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?",PENNY,PENNY

8916,Alcohol.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8917,Won’t my footsteps set it off?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8918,What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8919,"Before you go, consider this.

All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.",SHELDON,SHELDON

8926,"Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.",SHELDON,HOWARD
8927,"Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.",PENNY,PENNY
8928,We’re good.,LEONARD,LEONARD

8935,Good night.,PENNY,LEONARD
8936,"Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?",PENNY,PENNY

8939,What’s with the wand and the beep?,HOWARD,HOWARD
8940,"I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.",HOWARD,LEONARD

8942,"Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?",RAJ,RAJ
8943,Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.,PENNY,HOWARD
8944,"We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says,  don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.",HOWARD,SHELDON

8948,Are you sure?,RAJ,LEONARD
8949,Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.,RAJ,SHELDON
8950,"Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.",RAJ,HOWARD
8951,"So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.",SHELDON,OTHERS
8952,"Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8953,Hey!,HOWARD,LEONARD
8954,We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.,OTHERS,SHELDON

9001,"Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.",LEONARD,PENNY
9002,What should we write?,HOWARD,SHELDON
9003,"But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.",HOWARD,SHELDON

9008,"So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?",HOWARD,HOWARD
9009,Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.,LEONARD,SHELDON

9012,We never got to the bedroom.,PENNY,LEONARD
9013,Excuse me?,OTHERS,LEONARD

9015,Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9016,"Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!",PENNY,HOWARD

9038,"Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?",PENNY,PENNY
9039,"No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9040,Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.,LEONARD,RAJ
9041,Hello?,RAJ,SHELDON
9042,"Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?",LEONARD,LEONARD

9050,"So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.",RAJ,HOWARD
9051,That’s true.,LEONARD,LEONARD

9056,Then what difference does it make?,PENNY,OTHERS
9057,Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.,SHELDON,SHELDON

9059,Sure.,RAJ,LEONARD
9060,"Stop, you’re gonna make me cry.",OTHERS,PENNY
9061,"Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard.",SHELDON,PENNY
9062,Leonard!,OTHERS,SHELDON
9063,I want to leave.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9064,That must’ve been expensive.,PENNY,LEONARD

9066,You should visit more often. What are you doing?,LEONARD,SHELDON
9067,"Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?",LEONARD,PENNY

9069,Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.,OTHERS,LEONARD

9071,Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.,LEONARD,PENNY

9074,Who had money on faints?,HOWARD,LEONARD

9078,Say what?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9079,I should go.,RAJ,LEONARD

9102,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9103,I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9104,"I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9105,The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9106,Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?,LEONARD,SHELDON

9135,He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission.,PENNY,RAJ
9136,"You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9137,Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.,HOWARD,SHELDON
9138,"Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.",LEONARD,PENNY
9139,Your shoes.,PENNY,SHELDON
9140,You sound kind of proud of it.,HOWARD,LEONARD

9149,Raj is teaching me to make croissants.,SHELDON,HOWARD
9150,"Great. Well, bye.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9151,"Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9152,This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.,OTHERS,OTHERS

9177,She’s not that kind of doctor.,HOWARD,LEONARD

9220,I don’t know.,LEONARD,PENNY

9263,Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.,HOWARD,PENNY
9264,"I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.",RAJ,PENNY
9265,"Hey guys, I got this.",PENNY,LEONARD
9266,What happened?,OTHERS,LEONARD
9267,My brother. He’s got a big crush on Bernadette.,OTHERS,RAJ
9268,"Um, yeah, sure, thanks.",PENNY,PENNY
9269,"According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9270,That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.,OTHERS,RAJ
9271,You’re back.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9272,"Hello? I’m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys’ large they had.",HOWARD,RAJ
9273,"No, it’s not.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9274,"Wait, I don’t think it’s Shatner.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9275,My last physical.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9276,"Sure, anything.",PENNY,LEONARD
9277,Guys.,PENNY,LEONARD
9278,Listen to you. How can I possibly go?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9279,Then how can I say it convincingly?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9280,Or a way for you to avoid her?,PENNY,SHELDON
9281,"I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”",SHELDON,SHELDON
9282,Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.,RAJ,SHELDON
9283,Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
9284,"I do, I’ll teach you.",PENNY,LEONARD
9285,Hello.,PENNY,SHELDON
9286,Formal protest.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9287,"Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.",RAJ,SHELDON
9288,"Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I’d say about a million dollars a pop.",HOWARD,HOWARD
9289,I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.,HOWARD,LEONARD
9290,You’re smart.,OTHERS,LEONARD
9291,I’m not happy.,PENNY,SHELDON
9292,"Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9293,Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9294,There’s absolutely no difference.,PENNY,LEONARD
9295,"Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?",HOWARD,SHELDON
9296,"Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.",HOWARD,HOWARD
9297,I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.,SHELDON,RAJ
9298,Hot dogs.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9299,"That’s really nice, Sheldon, I’m happy for you.",LEONARD,PENNY
9300,"You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.",OTHERS,PENNY
9301,"Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman.",OTHERS,PENNY
9302,"Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?",SHELDON,SHELDON
9303,"Aw, Mom.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9304,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9305,"Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9306,Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9307,"Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.",RAJ,SHELDON
9308,So what did she say when you told her we were going out?,PENNY,LEONARD
9309,What a jerk.,PENNY,LEONARD
9310,"Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?",PENNY,LEONARD
9311,"Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!",LEONARD,LEONARD
9312,"She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”",HOWARD,HOWARD
9313,That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9314,"I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9315,"No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9316,It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.,PENNY,OTHERS
9317,That was such a fun night.,PENNY,OTHERS
9318,"Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9319,"Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9320,"Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?",PENNY,HOWARD
9321,"Guys, how ’bout some music?",PENNY,PENNY
9322,Four thirty.,HOWARD,LEONARD
9323,You want to play Cylon and colonist?,HOWARD,HOWARD
9324,"Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9325,"Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.",LEONARD,PENNY
9326,"Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.",RAJ,SHELDON
9327,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9328,"You’re right, it’s great.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9329,Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?,RAJ,LEONARD
9330,"Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9331,Whoa!,LEONARD,LEONARD
9332,"You know, I can really do this by myself.",LEONARD,PENNY
9333,"Uh, no, thank you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9334,Give me that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9335,It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.,PENNY,SHELDON
9336,"Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9337,What? How did you manage that?,PENNY,LEONARD
9338,"So, that’s what you wear to an interview?",SHELDON,PENNY
9339,"Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours.",PENNY,LEONARD
9340,"Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you’ll make a great hooker.",PENNY,PENNY
9341,"You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9342,"You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9343,I appreciate it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9344,"For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9345,"Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.",LEONARD,PENNY
9346,It can’t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?,HOWARD,SHELDON
9347,"I don’t make the rules, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9348,"So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.",OTHERS,PENNY
9349,He likes your eyes.,HOWARD,OTHERS
9350,"Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.",HOWARD,PENNY
9351,When do we leave?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9352,"Okay, what do you think?",PENNY,PENNY
9353,"No, it’s not.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9354,"We don’t have to go that far, there are other means available.",HOWARD,SHELDON
9355,I hate all of you and myself. Three.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9356,You’ve heard of French toast?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9357,"Well, then have the robot go and get him.",PENNY,LEONARD
9358,"Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.",PENNY,SHELDON
9359,"No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.",SHELDON,HOWARD
9360,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.",HOWARD,RAJ
9361,"No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme.",SHELDON,PENNY
9362,Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.,HOWARD,LEONARD
9363,I’m so mad at you!,RAJ,OTHERS
9364,"I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9365,Thanks. I love hockey.,RAJ,OTHERS
9366,"You’re tricking me. It really is, isn’t it?",SHELDON,SHELDON
9367,Hey. Want to join us?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9368,Okay. Do whatever you want.,PENNY,PENNY
9369,That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9370,Fine.  Happy?,PENNY,LEONARD
9371,USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.,RAJ,OTHERS
9372,"I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?",LEONARD,SHELDON
9373,What’s the dress code?,OTHERS,PENNY
9374,"Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
