58,It’s Oatmeal Day.,SHELDON,SHELDON
59,"It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction.

110,"As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed.

605,"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.",SHELDON,SHELDON
606,I can’t tell you.,SHELDON,PENNY
607,"Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.",LEONARD,SHELDON
608,Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.,SHELDON,PENNY

613,"You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.",RAJ,SHELDON
614,Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.,PENNY,LEONARD
615,"No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
616,"So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?",LEONARD,LEONARD

625,Thank you Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
626,Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.,RAJ,SHELDON
627,When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?,SHELDON,SHELDON
628,"No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
629,"Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.",SHELDON,SHELDON

637,Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?,OTHERS,LEONARD

647,"They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey.",RAJ,SHELDON
648,"Well, I cannot give this stuff away.",SHELDON,PENNY
649,"That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.",SHELDON,SHELDON
650,"I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?",HOWARD,SHELDON
651,I don’t see how you could.,SHELDON,SHELDON
652,"Ugh, what can you do? Here.",PENNY,PENNY

659,"I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?",HOWARD,SHELDON
660,"If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
661,"Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.",HOWARD,HOWARD
662,It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.,LEONARD,LEONARD

677,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
678,"Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?",OTHERS,HOWARD
679,"No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?",OTHERS,PENNY
680,Try and stop me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
681,I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.,RAJ,OTHERS

708,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?,RAJ,SHELDON
709,I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.,SHELDON,SHELDON

718,I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.,OTHERS,PENNY
719,"Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.",PENNY,LEONARD
720,You brought a lawyer?,HOWARD,LEONARD
721,What do you suppose she meant by that?,RAJ,SHELDON
722,I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.,SHELDON,PENNY
723,"Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.",LEONARD,SHELDON
724,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
725,"Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.",PENNY,LEONARD

729,Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.,SHELDON,SHELDON
730,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
731,I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?,SHELDON,OTHERS
732,And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn’t prove I know Batman.,SHELDON,SHELDON
733,"Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool.",LEONARD,PENNY
734,"Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.",SHELDON,HOWARD
735,"It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them.",SHELDON,SHELDON
736,Okay.,LEONARD,PENNY
737,I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?,LEONARD,PENNY
738,"When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.",OTHERS,OTHERS
739,With your career?,LEONARD,SHELDON
740,"Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.",PENNY,RAJ
741,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
742,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
743,I don’t really feel I deserve it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
744,"Ah, touché.",SHELDON,SHELDON
745,Not yet. There it is.,PENNY,LEONARD

749,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD

752,Quantum physics makes me so happy.,SHELDON,RAJ
753,Hello? Anybody home?,OTHERS,SHELDON
754,"Yes, he was always working on this.",OTHERS,LEONARD
755,"Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.",RAJ,RAJ
756,"Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.",SHELDON,SHELDON
757,"No, I can’t eat melon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
758,Are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?,PENNY,SHELDON
759,"That’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
760,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,PENNY
761,By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal.,SHELDON,SHELDON
762,You okay?,HOWARD,PENNY
763,"Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by.",RAJ,RAJ
764,"You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal",SHELDON,SHELDON
765,"Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut.",LEONARD,PENNY
766,What?,SHELDON,LEONARD
767,"No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
768,"All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true.",SHELDON,SHELDON
769,"You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you.",OTHERS,PENNY
770,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
771,"Oh, my God.",HOWARD,PENNY
772,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
773,Where we going?,HOWARD,LEONARD
774,"Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.",OTHERS,OTHERS
775,I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker.,OTHERS,OTHERS

777,"Oh, well, that’s the best part.",RAJ,PENNY
778,"What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?",RAJ,PENNY
779,"Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead.",HOWARD,SHELDON
780,"Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.",LEONARD,PENNY

783,"Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen.",SHELDON,SHELDON
784,"I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?",OTHERS,PENNY
785,I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.,SHELDON,SHELDON
786,"It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure.",SHELDON,LEONARD
787,Probably.,LEONARD,LEONARD
788,"Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.",SHELDON,LEONARD
789,"Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.",RAJ,SHELDON
790,You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.,LEONARD,OTHERS
791,"Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…",PENNY,PENNY
792,"But, boy, it is funny to think about.",LEONARD,SHELDON
793,"For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.",OTHERS,LEONARD
794,"Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room.",SHELDON,SHELDON
795,Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?,RAJ,HOWARD
796,"Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?",PENNY,PENNY
797,"No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn.",SHELDON,SHELDON
798,"First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.",SHELDON,SHELDON
799,"Well, thank you for a really cool evening.",PENNY,PENNY

805,"No, her bed kind of… broke.",LEONARD,LEONARD
806,"Hi, how was the screening?",PENNY,PENNY
807,"Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.",SHELDON,SHELDON
808,You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.,LEONARD,LEONARD
809,"Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.",SHELDON,SHELDON
810,Can I stay at your place for a few nights?,PENNY,LEONARD
811,Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.,HOWARD,HOWARD
812,I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.,SHELDON,SHELDON
813,"May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.",RAJ,SHELDON
814,Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.,SHELDON,LEONARD
815,A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.,RAJ,SHELDON
816,"Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.",OTHERS,RAJ
817,That’s right. And what did he do?,SHELDON,LEONARD
818,It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.,LEONARD,SHELDON
819,"Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.",OTHERS,HOWARD
820,"That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?",SHELDON,PENNY
821,"Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…",OTHERS,RAJ

823,"Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.",LEONARD,PENNY
824,I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
825,"Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.",SHELDON,SHELDON
826,"Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.",RAJ,LEONARD
827,Why?,SHELDON,LEONARD
828,"This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.",LEONARD,HOWARD
829,"I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.",SHELDON,SHELDON
830,I know.,OTHERS,LEONARD
831,"Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.",OTHERS,OTHERS
832,No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?,HOWARD,RAJ

834,"Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.",PENNY,SHELDON
835,"No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.",OTHERS,RAJ
836,What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.,SHELDON,SHELDON
837,"Oh, so our love is not real?",HOWARD,PENNY
838,I’ll see you around.,RAJ,LEONARD
839,"I just don’t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I’m abandoning Halley. If I don’t go, I’m giving up everything I worked for. It’s like there’s no right choice.",OTHERS,HOWARD
840,"Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.",PENNY,PENNY
841,"And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.",OTHERS,SHELDON
842,"No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.",LEONARD,SHELDON
843,"No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.",LEONARD,PENNY
844,"But, what about your time machine.",PENNY,SHELDON
845,I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
846,"This is a treat, what brings you guys by?",RAJ,PENNY
847,"So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?",LEONARD,LEONARD
848,"Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs.",PENNY,PENNY
849,Uh-huh.,LEONARD,LEONARD
850,"No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about.",PENNY,PENNY
851,"Run, Monte, run!",LEONARD,SHELDON
852,"The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.",SHELDON,LEONARD

854,"Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.",RAJ,PENNY
855,Translation?,PENNY,SHELDON
856,"Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.",RAJ,SHELDON
857,"Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.",HOWARD,HOWARD
858,Why?,RAJ,LEONARD
859,"Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.",RAJ,PENNY
860,I don’t think so.,OTHERS,LEONARD
861,No.,SHELDON,LEONARD
862,I don’t know. Go with hockey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
863,But I was summing up.,RAJ,SHELDON
864,"Hey, where’s Bernadette?",LEONARD,HOWARD
865,"I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?",SHELDON,SHELDON
866,How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.,SHELDON,SHELDON
867,On occasion.,LEONARD,SHELDON
868,"So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?",LEONARD,SHELDON

870,"Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?",PENNY,PENNY
871,Alfred. Thank you for coming!,PENNY,SHELDON
872,"No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.",LEONARD,SHELDON
873,"Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.",HOWARD,SHELDON
874,What do you do in there?,OTHERS,LEONARD
875,"You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON
876,"I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
877,"No, that was a different, different guy.",LEONARD,LEONARD

879,"No, thank you.",PENNY,LEONARD

1187,"Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1188,"Thank you, but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father.",RAJ,SHELDON
1189,"Yeah, try doing it in heels.",OTHERS,HOWARD

1207,Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.,SHELDON,HOWARD

1209,"Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1210,"Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1211,Aw. I’m gonna miss her.,OTHERS,PENNY
1212,That’s it? No compassion?,HOWARD,SHELDON

1221,"Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!",RAJ,SHELDON
1222,Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can’t Spy? It’s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1223,That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.,PENNY,RAJ
1224,"Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working today, right?",HOWARD,HOWARD

1231,Mmm.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1232,Yes.,HOWARD,LEONARD

1235,How would you put it?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1236,He’s back.,HOWARD,SHELDON

1239,"Look at that, you shaved it all.",OTHERS,HOWARD

1245,"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1246,"Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1247,"Oh, that sounds lovely.",RAJ,OTHERS
1248,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1249,Aced it.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1250,We’re getting to him.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1251,"Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship.",SHELDON,SHELDON

1257,"Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He’s your best friend.",PENNY,SHELDON
1258,"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1259,Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.,LEONARD,RAJ
1260,They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.,HOWARD,LEONARD

1274,I know.,RAJ,LEONARD
1275,"I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?",SHELDON,SHELDON

1286,"Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1287,I don’t follow.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1288,"Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1289,During which she defected to North Korea.,RAJ,SHELDON
1290,"Sorry. She’s taken, too.",PENNY,LEONARD
1291,"Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.",OTHERS,RAJ
1292,"Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1293,"Yeah, it was first come, first served.",RAJ,SHELDON
1294,Beats the hell out of me.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1295,This is getting fun. What’s next?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1296,"It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1297,All right.,OTHERS,SHELDON

1299,"Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour..",OTHERS,SHELDON
1300,Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.,SHELDON,PENNY
1301,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1302,Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.,PENNY,RAJ
1303,"Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1304,I don’t want to talk to her.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1305,I don’t understand.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1306,"Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1307,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.,RAJ,LEONARD
1308,Won’t make us any younger.,PENNY,LEONARD
1309,It’s slowing down.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1310,"I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.",SHELDON,PENNY
1311,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1312,"Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1313,She was sleeping with you?,RAJ,LEONARD
1314,"Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.",PENNY,PENNY
1315,I’m fine.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1316,Mm.,PENNY,PENNY
1317,"Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1318,"All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1319,"Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1320,"Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1321,Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1322,"Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.",RAJ,PENNY
1323,"Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.",RAJ,HOWARD
1324,Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.,PENNY,HOWARD
1325,"A little, yeah.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1326,"Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1327,"Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye.",OTHERS,PENNY

1329,Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1330,"What do you want, Sheldon?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1331,"Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1332,They have some board games.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1333,"I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1334,I want oatmeal.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1335,"Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.",RAJ,LEONARD

1340,I hear that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1341,"Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.",HOWARD,PENNY
1342,"Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.",PENNY,SHELDON
1343,"I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1344,Did they hate it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1345,"Oh, I took care of it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1346,"Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?",PENNY,PENNY

1348,Because you feel guilty?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1349,"Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard…",SHELDON,SHELDON
1350,What name?,PENNY,SHELDON
1351,"What? no. no, that’s not right.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1352,"Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point.",PENNY,PENNY
1353,Are you single?,RAJ,OTHERS
1354,"Howard, help me out here.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1355,"Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1356,You don’t say.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1357,"Well, you were right, tears.",LEONARD,PENNY
1358,It’s kind of dawning on me now.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1359,"I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.",OTHERS,OTHERS

1361,My mommy raised a gentleman.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1362,Use your best judgement.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1363,"Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1364,No problem.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1365,He’s not my boyfriend.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1366,"Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.",PENNY,LEONARD
1367,Wrong answer.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1368,"Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.",PENNY,PENNY
1369,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…",SHELDON,SHELDON
1370,"Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1371,"Well, could you look at Toby?",HOWARD,RAJ

1373,Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1374,"In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1375,"Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.",LEONARD,LEONARD

1377,"Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1378,Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1379,I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.,RAJ,SHELDON
1380,Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.,OTHERS,HOWARD
1381,This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1382,Can’t you just tell me?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1383,"All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1384,"Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?",PENNY,RAJ
1385,I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1386,What’s going on with Amy?,OTHERS,PENNY
1387,Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.,RAJ,SHELDON
1388,"Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1389,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
1390,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD

1398,I’m not gonna get fat.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1399,"Oh, hi.",PENNY,PENNY
1400,"You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1401,"Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist.",LEONARD,PENNY
1402,"What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1403,It could be a trans-Neptunian object.,RAJ,RAJ
1404,What is it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1405,I know someone who would disagree.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1406,"It’s totally different. Bert’s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.",LEONARD,PENNY

1422,Really? Cool.,RAJ,LEONARD
1423,Ew.,PENNY,PENNY
1424,"Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.",OTHERS,OTHERS

1426,You still have a girlfriend.,OTHERS,LEONARD

1429,"No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1430,Oh!,SHELDON,SHELDON
1431,"Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1432,Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1433,Had to or got to? Sorry.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1434,"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”",SHELDON,RAJ
1435,It’d be swell if they had a train.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1436,This conversation is making me uncomfortable.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1437,"Oh, I see you’re reading Saga.",RAJ,SHELDON
1438,"It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1439,"So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?",HOWARD,LEONARD
1440,"Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.",SHELDON,OTHERS

1586,"If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1587,"Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1588,Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.,LEONARD,LEONARD

1607,"Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?",RAJ,SHELDON
1608,"Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.",SHELDON,SHELDON

1613,Really? Are you drunk?,PENNY,PENNY
1614,What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1615,Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1616,Mmmm.,PENNY,LEONARD
1617,Okay.,SHELDON,PENNY
1618,God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!,OTHERS,HOWARD

1623,"Yes, ma’am.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1624,What’s going on?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1625,"It was. And even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1626,"Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.",PENNY,PENNY

1651,It’s really good.,PENNY,LEONARD

1732,"Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1733,Hi.,OTHERS,PENNY
1734,"And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1735,"Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1736,"You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1737,Oh dear.,RAJ,SHELDON
1738,"You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1739,"So, is that a yes?",SHELDON,LEONARD
1740,I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1741,"Well, you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.",PENNY,PENNY
1742,"Sheldon, are you okay?",PENNY,PENNY
1743,Never should have told you my middle name.,HOWARD,OTHERS
1744,"Don’t come in, Ma!",HOWARD,HOWARD
1745,Took the words right out of my mouth.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1746,"Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1747,"Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.",PENNY,SHELDON
1748,"If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1749,I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!,HOWARD,SHELDON
1750,And send.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1751,"Yeah, it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.",PENNY,SHELDON
1752,I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1753,"No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1754,"Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em.",OTHERS,PENNY
1755,"Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.",PENNY,PENNY
1756,"Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1757,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1758,"Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1759,"Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.",PENNY,PENNY
1760,"Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.",PENNY,PENNY
1761,"Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1762,Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1763,"Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.",PENNY,LEONARD
1764,That is some low-hanging fruit.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1765,"It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1766,"No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1767,"Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me.",SHELDON,RAJ
1768,Let’s find out.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1769,It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1770,"Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1771,Why wasn’t that Plan A?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1772,"Then, maybe you should let it go.",PENNY,LEONARD
1773,That’s what my sister used to say.,SHELDON,RAJ
1774,"And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1775,"Ah, hey Leslie.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1776,Aw.,PENNY,PENNY
1777,"I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1778,You are.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1779,I’d love some.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1780,"Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1781,"Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1782,Call you back.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1783,"It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.",SHELDON,PENNY
1784,"Essentially, yes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1785,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1786,"Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1787,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?,SHELDON,HOWARD
1788,"Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.",OTHERS,RAJ
1789,What? He said he was fine.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1790,"Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!",SHELDON,SHELDON
1791,"Yeah, buddy?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1792,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1793,Oh. Oh. Thank you.,PENNY,SHELDON
1794,"Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?",LEONARD,HOWARD
1795,"Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?",OTHERS,OTHERS
1796,What does she want from me now?  What’s up?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1797,"It’s… you know, time machine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1798,"Howard, please, I’m begging you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1799,"Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1800,"Ha, you’re interested. You’re out ten bucks.",HOWARD,PENNY
1801,"Give me a minute. Sheldon,",LEONARD,LEONARD
1802,"You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1803,So?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1804,"What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don’t you like me?",HOWARD,HOWARD
1805,The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1806,"Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1807,To what? Toy Story?,RAJ,PENNY

1811,How’s it working out?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1812,"Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1813,"I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.",PENNY,PENNY
1814,You heard what I did?,PENNY,LEONARD
1815,Fine. With.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1816,"That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.",HOWARD,RAJ
1817,That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.,RAJ,OTHERS
1818,"Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better.",LEONARD,PENNY
1819,Really? You want to see the keynote?,HOWARD,SHELDON
1820,"Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.",PENNY,SHELDON
1821,Don’t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1822,"Okay, now you’re starting to make me mad.",OTHERS,PENNY
1823,This food is amazing.,PENNY,LEONARD
1824,How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1825,Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1826,You have to go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1827,You bet I did.,SHELDON,OTHERS
1828,I know. We’ve been waiting so long for this.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1829,"Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1830,Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1831,"I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1832,Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s how I learned.,HOWARD,PENNY
1833,Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?,PENNY,SHELDON
1834,"No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1835,Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?,RAJ,SHELDON
1836,"So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?",PENNY,PENNY
1837,"Uh oh, what’s going on?",OTHERS,PENNY
1838,"Okay, good.",HOWARD,PENNY
1839,"I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home.",RAJ,SHELDON
1840,"All right, I’d like an order of fries.",PENNY,SHELDON
1841,It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1842,No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.,OTHERS,HOWARD
1843,We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.,RAJ,LEONARD
1844,"Alright, why not five and ten bucks?",PENNY,PENNY
1845,"No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1846,Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?,HOWARD,HOWARD
1847,What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
1848,"Good night, Rocket Man.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1849,"You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1850,"Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1851,All right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1852,"Number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1853,Did not know that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1854,"Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1855,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
1856,I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.,OTHERS,PENNY
1857,Nope.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1858,Should we go?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1859,"Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it.",OTHERS,PENNY
1860,I’m not going with you to Comic-Con.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1861,A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1862,"Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?",LEONARD,PENNY
1863,Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1864,"Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1865,"Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.",PENNY,HOWARD
1866,"Hello, Stuart.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1867,"Why should I do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming.",LEONARD,RAJ
1868,"Sweetie, you are grown up.",PENNY,PENNY
1869,Really don’t care.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1870,It really can.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1871,So how’s Amy?,PENNY,PENNY
1872,"Well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?",OTHERS,PENNY
1873,"Oh, sure.",OTHERS,PENNY
1874,"Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali",SHELDON,SHELDON
1875,"Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.",PENNY,PENNY
1876,Good story.,RAJ,LEONARD
1877,Survival training? Is that like camping?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1878,"Oh, that is so awesome.",OTHERS,PENNY
1879,"Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1880,"No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1881,"Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1882,"Sheldon, why are you doing this?",LEONARD,PENNY
1883,I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1884,Of what? Poorly executed beards?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1885,"Yeah, probably.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1886,What do you mean?,RAJ,LEONARD
1887,Who’s there?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1888,I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!,RAJ,SHELDON
1889,For what?,PENNY,LEONARD
1890,"Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.",RAJ,RAJ
1891,"Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.",LEONARD,HOWARD
1892,"No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1893,That’s so sweet.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1894,"Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.",PENNY,PENNY
1895,Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1896,Zone.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1897,I’m on the day care’s website.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1898,Two trains?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1899,You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1900,Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1901,"I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1902,"That’s fascinating, but I…",LEONARD,SHELDON
1903,Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.,PENNY,SHELDON
1904,"Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?",RAJ,PENNY
1905,Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1906,She’s remarkable.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1907,Colonel Williams. Sir.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1908,"Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you.",SHELDON,LEONARD

1913,"I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1914,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1915,"Of course you didn’t, he said little idea?",SHELDON,LEONARD
1916,Oh great.,LEONARD,PENNY
1917,Nothing.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1918,"No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1919,I’d still like to know who Jerry is.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1920,"Hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little.",PENNY,PENNY
1921,"Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God’s sake!",HOWARD,LEONARD
1922,Nothing.,PENNY,LEONARD
1923,"Where did he go?  We’re looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1924,"Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1925,"C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1926,"Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1927,"Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1928,"Don’t talk, just drink.",PENNY,SHELDON
1929,"Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?",SHELDON,PENNY
1930,Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.,OTHERS,PENNY
1931,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1932,"You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here.  Get up.  There. Problem solved.  Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1933,Hi.,LEONARD,PENNY
1934,"First of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1935,Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1936,"I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.",LEONARD,HOWARD
1937,You went to the comic-book store by yourself?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1938,And to clarify?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1939,"Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1940,Keep walking.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1941,Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1942,That’s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn’t even that hard.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1943,"You know, there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that.  You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say",PENNY,SHELDON
1944,"Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking’s not busy because I can see he’s playing other people right now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1945,"Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1946,"All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.",RAJ,PENNY
1947,"I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant.",LEONARD,HOWARD
1948,I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1949,"Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1950,What are you doing?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1951,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1952,See-ka-tong-guay-jow.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1953,"Cut to the chase, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1954,"Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?",LEONARD,PENNY
1955,"No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1956,"Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1957,"Golly, she sounds too good to be true.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1958,Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1959,"I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.",LEONARD,PENNY
1960,Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?,HOWARD,SHELDON
1961,"Oh, that is not true.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1962,"Hey, guys, this package came for y…",PENNY,PENNY
1963,Not particularly.,HOWARD,SHELDON

1965,He told you?,PENNY,LEONARD
1966,"Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?",OTHERS,LEONARD

1968,"Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.",RAJ,SHELDON
1969,"Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.",OTHERS,OTHERS

1972,There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1973,"Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life.",PENNY,LEONARD
1974,"Ooh, that looks like fun.",PENNY,OTHERS
1975,"That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.",LEONARD,PENNY
1976,I didn’t say that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1977,"Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.",RAJ,HOWARD

1981,All right.,PENNY,SHELDON
1982,"Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?",HOWARD,PENNY
1983,"Oh, I’m not sure we should.",LEONARD,PENNY

1985,You want to drive?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1986,"Hey, guys.",RAJ,LEONARD
1987,Is qochbe’ spelled with a?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1988,"Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward.",LEONARD,PENNY
1989,"Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1990,– Oh.,PENNY,PENNY
1991,"Hey, Sheldon?",HOWARD,PENNY
1992,It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1993,"Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.",LEONARD,SHELDON

1996,Don’t you just hate when this happens?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1997,"Great, be right back.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1998,What for?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1999,"Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.",RAJ,RAJ
2000,"Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?",RAJ,PENNY
2001,"Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2002,That could work.,SHELDON,LEONARD

2284,I would not.,PENNY,SHELDON
2285,Amy?  Amy?  Amy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2286,Told you not to ask.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2287,"Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?",LEONARD,PENNY
2288,"Yeah. Shoes, I’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I’m an eight.",PENNY,HOWARD
2289,I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.,LEONARD,PENNY
2290,I need to see this.,PENNY,SHELDON
2291,"So, Polly, tell me about yourself.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2292,I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.,OTHERS,RAJ
2293,Forty-five.,RAJ,HOWARD
2294,Yes. Are you writing a book?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2295,I don’t see why not.,RAJ,SHELDON
2296,"Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?",PENNY,SHELDON
2297,Will you please turn your shirt off?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2298,"Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2299,"Ooh, I like when you take charge.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2300,"So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?",RAJ,HOWARD
2301,Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2302,"No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2303,I can. I choose not to.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2304,"Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2305,"Thanks. You, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2306,"I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”",LEONARD,HOWARD
2307,"Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2308,Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2309,It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.,RAJ,RAJ
2310,Vintage? Be specific.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2311,Bleugh!,SHELDON,SHELDON
2312,Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2313,Maybe we can do it next week.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2314,Anything else?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2315,No problem.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2316,"Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.",RAJ,RAJ
2317,"Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.",RAJ,SHELDON
2318,"But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2319,"I can’t do it, he’s my best client.",PENNY,HOWARD
2320,That’s nice. What about?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2321,"Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.",RAJ,RAJ
2322,All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2323,Please just go to the store.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2324,"Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2325,I thought I didn’t have a problem.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2326,"No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.",PENNY,SHELDON
2327,And? How did it make you feel?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2328,"Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2329,Hello Sheldon.,RAJ,OTHERS
2330,What’s the difference?,PENNY,LEONARD
2331,"What up, guys?",RAJ,PENNY
2332,Yeah. Sure. How are things going?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2333,"That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2334,Trust me.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2335,How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?,PENNY,HOWARD
2336,"Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?",HOWARD,SHELDON
2337,"The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2338,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2339,You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2340,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
2341,Leonard.,PENNY,SHELDON
2342,That’s because you made him more confident.,OTHERS,OTHERS
2343,"Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me.",RAJ,PENNY
2344,Ice cream?,PENNY,SHELDON
2345,"Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.",RAJ,PENNY
2346,"Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.",RAJ,PENNY
2347,What’s wrong?,PENNY,LEONARD
2348,"Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.",RAJ,HOWARD
2349,Really? Never?,PENNY,LEONARD
2350,She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2351,"Hey, there he is.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2352,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2353,I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2354,I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2355,Don’t say that to him.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2356,"Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.",PENNY,PENNY
2357,Stuart took that rejection like a pro.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2358,"Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2359,Thank you.,RAJ,SHELDON
2360,Hey. Long time no see.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2361,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2362,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2363,"Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2364,"But, Howard…",RAJ,LEONARD
2365,"You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.",OTHERS,PENNY
2366,"Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.",RAJ,LEONARD
2367,What the hell? How long has she been here?,LEONARD,PENNY
2368,Star Wars?,PENNY,SHELDON
2369,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2370,"Coming!. Greetings, friends.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2371,"Yeah, let’s go.",PENNY,PENNY
2372,They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2373,"Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2374,It’s just so humiliating.,PENNY,PENNY
2375,Who else’s side could you have been on?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2376,Sheldon!,LEONARD,LEONARD
2377,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Empty room.  Empty room.  Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.",SHELDON,PENNY
2378,"Oh, I’m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek…",SHELDON,SHELDON
2379,I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.,PENNY,SHELDON
2380,"Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2381,Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?,RAJ,RAJ
2382,"Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2383,When was your honour insulted?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2384,That’s classified.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2385,This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2386,It probably won’t.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2387,"Oh, hey.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2388,"I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2389,I just gave it to her!,HOWARD,HOWARD
2390,She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2391,"I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2392,So what are we going to do tonight?,RAJ,LEONARD
2393,"I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle.",HOWARD,RAJ
2394,"Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize.",RAJ,PENNY
2395,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2396,Ay-yi-yi.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2397,He’s got Amy now.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2398,That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2399,"Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2400,"Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?",PENNY,OTHERS
2401,"You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2402,Let’s just take the test.,PENNY,LEONARD
2403,"Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that.",PENNY,PENNY
2404,"And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2405,Maybe I could go in a little late.,LEONARD,OTHERS
2406,"Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2407,"Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?",PENNY,LEONARD
2408,"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2409,You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do…,LEONARD,OTHERS
2410,Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2411,"Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.",PENNY,PENNY
2412,"Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes.",RAJ,RAJ
2413,"I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2414,"Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.",HOWARD,PENNY
2415,"He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!",RAJ,SHELDON
2416,"No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2417,"Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2418,Sexual needs.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2419,Why are you introducing yourself?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2420,"Wow, centrifugal force!",PENNY,LEONARD
2421,Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2422,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2423,I don’t understand.,PENNY,SHELDON
2424,"Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2425,"On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2426,Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.,PENNY,LEONARD
2427,"If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2428,The one with the frogs.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2429,"Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me.",LEONARD,PENNY
2430,"Goodnight, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2431,"Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2432,"Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,",PENNY,PENNY
2433,One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2434,"Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant?.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2435,About what?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2436,"Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!",SHELDON,SHELDON
2437,And astrology.,PENNY,RAJ
2438,"See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?",LEONARD,PENNY
2439,Thanks. I’ll call you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2440,"Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So it works as two.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2441,"And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?",HOWARD,SHELDON
2442,Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2443,Sheldon.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2444,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2445,Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2446,"Hey, we can say it. You can’t.",RAJ,LEONARD
2447,"Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2448,No.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2449,Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.,RAJ,LEONARD
2450,Yes?,RAJ,SHELDON
2451,Okay.,OTHERS,PENNY
2452,"Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2453,"Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.",LEONARD,PENNY
2454,"Whatever your secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, so I’m not interested.",PENNY,LEONARD
2455,What’s the matter.,RAJ,LEONARD
2456,I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2457,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2458,T-minus 60 seconds.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2459,"No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2460,"Yeah, I guessed that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2461,"Oh, uh, he’s crazy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2462,"Ha-ha. No, you’re not.",PENNY,LEONARD
2463,I’m androgynous?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2464,Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!,SHELDON,SHELDON
2465,Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.,PENNY,SHELDON
2466,You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2467,You’re not the guy.,PENNY,LEONARD
2468,He’s right. And I’m sorry for the part I played in this.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2469,I thought I just did.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2470,I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2471,I’m focusing on my job.,PENNY,OTHERS
2472,"Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.",PENNY,PENNY
2473,"Of course I won’t. No, I won’t.",PENNY,SHELDON
2474,Unbelievable.,PENNY,PENNY
2475,"Yeah, perfect.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2476,"No, p-please don’t.",RAJ,LEONARD
2477,You guys suck.,RAJ,LEONARD
2478,What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2479,I just threw up the bachelor party.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2480,Oh. It. Was.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2481,"You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?",OTHERS,LEONARD
2482,"Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.",PENNY,LEONARD
2483,I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.,RAJ,LEONARD
2484,"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2485,It sure was.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2486,You could talk some smack about his mother.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2487,"Oh, good.",PENNY,LEONARD
2488,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
2489,I just thought it would make you happy.,PENNY,OTHERS
2490,Go home.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2491,Eight-five.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2492,What happened?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2493,Shh. Amy’s here now.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2494,"Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.",SHELDON,RAJ
2495,"Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.",PENNY,PENNY
2496,What’s that supposed to mean?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2497,Are you sure?,PENNY,LEONARD
2498,"We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2499,I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2500,"Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.",RAJ,SHELDON
2501,Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.,RAJ,OTHERS
2502,Sorry we have to do this.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2503,"Oh, we have to use the stairs.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2504,"There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.",OTHERS,RAJ
2505,Check it out. Free chair.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2506,"Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?",HOWARD,PENNY
2507,I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2508,I asked.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2509,I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2510,Go hide.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2511,That’ll do it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2512,"Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2513,Fine.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2514,So Howard back Monday?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2515,"Ooh, let’s find out.",OTHERS,PENNY
2516,Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2517,Congratulations.,RAJ,SHELDON
2518,You still told her I lied.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2519,"As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2520,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2521,"Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2522,Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2523,"Anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.",PENNY,HOWARD
2524,"It’s just, it’s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know.",PENNY,PENNY
2525,You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.,PENNY,LEONARD
2526,"Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…",RAJ,PENNY
2527,"No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.",LEONARD,PENNY
2528,Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.,OTHERS,PENNY
2529,"Uh, yeah, sure, I’ll check with Leonard.",PENNY,PENNY
2530,"Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.",LEONARD,PENNY
2531,Sounds great.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2532,It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.,RAJ,HOWARD
2533,Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?,HOWARD,PENNY
2534,"Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up, I knock ’em down, good job.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2535,That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2536,He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2537,"Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.",PENNY,PENNY
2538,"Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2539,"Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2540,"If we were, the food would be better.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2541,"Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.",RAJ,PENNY
2542,"Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?",LEONARD,PENNY
2543,Please don’t shut me out.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2544,Missy?,PENNY,SHELDON
2545,"It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2546,"Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay.",RAJ,PENNY
2547,You’re sure you’re okay?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2548,"Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2549,"I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2550,"Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2551,"Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny.",PENNY,LEONARD
2552,"You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2553,Son of a bitch.,PENNY,HOWARD
2554,Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.,RAJ,SHELDON
2555,Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2556,Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2557,I don’t think the lever’s working.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2558,Here’s your tee-shirt.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2559,"I love you, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2560,"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2561,Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2562,I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2563,Uh-oh.,PENNY,LEONARD
2564,We’re good.,RAJ,LEONARD
2565,"Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?",PENNY,SHELDON
2566,What’s the plan?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2567,"I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2568,"Oh, thank you.",PENNY,SHELDON

2591,Bye.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2592,"That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…",LEONARD,LEONARD
2593,"All right, colour me intrigued.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2594,"No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2595,"Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2596,You’re not helping.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2597,Why are you asking?,PENNY,SHELDON
2598,"I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2599,"Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2600,"If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2601,I do eat dinner.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2602,I got the blues. My baby done left me.,SHELDON,HOWARD

2605,"I’m about to lose control, and I think I like it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2606,"You’re kidding, why not?",LEONARD,LEONARD

2616,I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.,PENNY,LEONARD
2617,"Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?",OTHERS,PENNY
2618,Huh! Sorry!,LEONARD,LEONARD
2619,That’s an amusing factoid.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2620,"No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2621,"Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.",SHELDON,RAJ
2622,He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?,OTHERS,LEONARD

2624,Hi.,PENNY,PENNY
2625,"Hey, uh, Bernadette, let’s test this theory. What do you think I’m feeling right now?",SHELDON,HOWARD
2626,How about one night and I let you whistle?,SHELDON,HOWARD

2628,Just pick another game.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2629,"Hear, hear.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2630,"Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2631,"I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2632,"Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?",PENNY,PENNY
2633,That’s what I’m saying.,LEONARD,LEONARD

2644,"All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.",PENNY,PENNY
2645,"Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here..",LEONARD,LEONARD
2646,It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2647,"Well, actually, technically, you did do it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2648,"No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.",HOWARD,SHELDON

2654,You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?,OTHERS,LEONARD

2664,"I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2665,"Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.  Hey, Sheldon, hope you’re hungry, they’re serving macaroni and…  che-ee-ee-ese.",RAJ,PENNY
2666,It’s a manifold.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2667,"I hope so, it was a snort of derision.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2668,"So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2669,"I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2670,Kurt!,PENNY,HOWARD
2671,Oh. Is that cute or creepy?,OTHERS,PENNY
2672,I had no idea you were unhappy.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2673,"Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.",PENNY,SHELDON
2674,"Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.",PENNY,SHELDON
2675,"Oh, that’s great.",OTHERS,PENNY
2676,"No, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2677,"Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.",HOWARD,OTHERS
2678,"Okay. Ready, set, go.",PENNY,HOWARD
2679,"Well, good night, son.",OTHERS,LEONARD

2690,"It’s just temporary, I pay rent.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2691,No.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2692,"You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!",LEONARD,SHELDON
2693,Damn. How’d you swing that?,HOWARD,HOWARD
2694,Done.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2695,"Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it.",RAJ,PENNY
2696,"You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.",RAJ,SHELDON
2697,"Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2698,Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2699,It’s just a phone.,RAJ,LEONARD
2700,"We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.",SHELDON,RAJ
2701,Nice flowers.,OTHERS,OTHERS
2702,Sarcasm?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2703,Sorry. Go on.,RAJ,LEONARD
2704,He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2705,"That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2706,"Sheldon, you’re being silly.",LEONARD,PENNY
2707,"Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2708,"Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?",PENNY,PENNY
2709,"Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2710,Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.,SHELDON,OTHERS

2724,Did you get the part?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2725,"Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I’d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn’t confuse it with what I’d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I’d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2726,"Mm, not really.",LEONARD,PENNY
2727,"Hey, Priya.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2728,"I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.",OTHERS,RAJ

2743,Move. Move. Move!,SHELDON,SHELDON
2744,And over here is Sheldon.,RAJ,LEONARD

2764,"Yeah, I guess.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2765,"Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2766,"Okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy.",LEONARD,PENNY
2767,It’s certainly preferable to my plan.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2768,"Yes, like a museum, but anything else.",PENNY,SHELDON
2769,But you have to add my name to your paper.,OTHERS,SHELDON

2775,Whoa. Not so fast.,PENNY,LEONARD
2776,Hi.,OTHERS,PENNY
2777,"Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.",SHELDON,SHELDON

2811,Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?,RAJ,SHELDON

2816,"Hey, you.",PENNY,LEONARD
2817,I don’t think so.,LEONARD,LEONARD

2819,Stuart?,RAJ,SHELDON
2820,"You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.",OTHERS,LEONARD

2822,"Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.",PENNY,SHELDON
2823,What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!,RAJ,PENNY
2824,Are you sure?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2825,You’re right. It sells itself.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2826,"Yeah, no.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2827,Go on.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2828,"Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go.",SHELDON,SHELDON

2830,"Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.",PENNY,SHELDON
2831,"No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2832,I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.,PENNY,SHELDON
2833,"All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?",LEONARD,PENNY
2834,"I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2835,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
2836,"That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment.",SHELDON,SHELDON

2838,"Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself.",PENNY,PENNY
2839,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2840,Thanks for the warning.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2841,Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?,LEONARD,LEONARD

2847,I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2848,"Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2849,"You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice.",OTHERS,PENNY
2850,"Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2851,Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?,OTHERS,HOWARD
2852,"Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them.",PENNY,PENNY
2853,Fine. And it’s a dickey.,HOWARD,HOWARD
2854,Hello Penny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2855,"Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2856,I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2857,"Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I’ll play.",PENNY,PENNY
2858,"Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2859,They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2860,She defends him all the time.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2861,"How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2862,N-n-n-nothing happened to me.,RAJ,LEONARD
2863,"No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.",PENNY,HOWARD
2864,"Okay, and tree pose.",RAJ,PENNY
2865,"Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.",LEONARD,RAJ
2866,Just roll the dice.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2867,"Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2868,"Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2869,"Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.",PENNY,HOWARD
2870,"Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.",PENNY,PENNY
2871,"She’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2872,"For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2873,"Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?",RAJ,PENNY
2874,How many is that now?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2875,"Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2876,"Uh, no.",PENNY,LEONARD
2877,Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2878,"Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?",HOWARD,LEONARD
2879,"Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.",PENNY,PENNY
2880,"Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?",PENNY,PENNY
2881,"This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2882,"Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2883,"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2884,"No, you’re the one who let him in.",RAJ,LEONARD
2885,"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2886,"Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?",PENNY,SHELDON
2887,Here we go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2888,Hello.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2889,No.,RAJ,LEONARD
2890,I’ve never played that before.,LEONARD,SHELDON

2892,Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.,RAJ,SHELDON
2893,Sure.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2894,"Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.",PENNY,PENNY
2895,"Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.",LEONARD,RAJ
2896,"Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2897,Hang on.,PENNY,LEONARD
2898,"I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2899,"No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.",RAJ,SHELDON
2900,"Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.",RAJ,RAJ
2901,Are we being silly not finding out the sex?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2902,Hello.,PENNY,SHELDON

2907,As advertised.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2908,Mmm.,PENNY,LEONARD

2910,"No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2911,Mm-hmm.,LEONARD,PENNY
2912,The ducks in my tub.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2913,"Other than the lack of water, how is it not?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2914,"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2915,"Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem.",LEONARD,PENNY
2916,Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2917,"Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?",PENNY,PENNY
2918,"I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.",PENNY,HOWARD

2925,"Waugh, romance ninja.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2926,Leonard! Stop the car!,SHELDON,SHELDON
2927,Nirsh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2928,"Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2929,Mmm.,PENNY,LEONARD
2930,I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2931,It’s Halo night.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2932,"It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked.  Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp!",SHELDON,SHELDON
2933,Wow. Can they?,PENNY,PENNY
2934,I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.,PENNY,LEONARD
2935,"It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2936,Thank you.,RAJ,SHELDON
2937,"Sure. The more, the merrier.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2938,Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2939,"No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2940,"I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?",OTHERS,OTHERS

2942,"Hey, Sheldon.",PENNY,PENNY
2943,"Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2944,None at all?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2945,"Nah, you got this. Let’s go for a drink. I’ll call Amy.",OTHERS,PENNY
2946,"Oh, the girls really did a nice job.",LEONARD,PENNY
2947,"Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.",PENNY,LEONARD
2948,"Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2949,Have you seen him?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2950,I just told you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2951,‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?,PENNY,SHELDON
2952,"You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2953,"Boy, do I have to urinate.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2954,"Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2955,"You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2956,"Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2957,"Oh really, did you make a second date.",HOWARD,PENNY
2958,Born and raised.,PENNY,OTHERS
2959,"And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2960,Will do.,RAJ,SHELDON
2961,I see. And is that open for discussion?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2962,"Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?",HOWARD,SHELDON
2963,"If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2964,It’s this stupid letter.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2965,I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.,LEONARD,PENNY
2966,"Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?",LEONARD,PENNY
2967,"You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2968,Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2969,"Uh, sure.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2970,"Although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be Penny.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2971,"Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.",RAJ,PENNY
2972,"Thank you, so do you.",PENNY,LEONARD
2973,"All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don’t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2974,"Oh, that’s cool.",HOWARD,PENNY
2975,"It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.",PENNY,LEONARD
2976,I mixed them.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2977,Then why are we drinking?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2978,Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!,HOWARD,SHELDON
2979,What’s going on?,PENNY,LEONARD
2980,In a safe place.,PENNY,SHELDON
2981,Separating my delicates.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2982,What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2983,"I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2984,"No, I miss her. I don’t know why I listened to you.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2985,"Come on, it wasn’t that bad.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2986,"Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2987,It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.,RAJ,LEONARD
2988,"And yet, I’m not.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2989,"You know what, I give up. He’s impossible.",PENNY,LEONARD
2990,"No, six thirty’s great.",PENNY,LEONARD
2991,First warning.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2992,"All I’m saying is, you know Leonard the best.",PENNY,PENNY
2993,"Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay.",HOWARD,PENNY
2994,"Wow, it looks really pretty in here.",PENNY,PENNY
2995,"Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2996,"Uh, I’m just gonna tell you the truth.",LEONARD,PENNY
2997,Is there anything we can do to help?,PENNY,LEONARD
2998,"Yeah, so?",HOWARD,LEONARD
2999,Yes?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3000,Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.,PENNY,HOWARD
3001,I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.,RAJ,RAJ
3002,Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3003,Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3004,I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.,RAJ,LEONARD
3005,Have you considered studying standard model physics?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3006,We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3007,And you think you can put up with Sheldon?,HOWARD,PENNY
3008,"Yes, I am.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3009,"April 13, a dark night, indeed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3010,That’s interesting.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3011,Did they figure out what’s wrong?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3012,"Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3013,"Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3014,"Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.",RAJ,LEONARD
3015,Hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
3016,But Sheldon….,PENNY,LEONARD
3017,Physiologically impossible.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3018,"Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?",HOWARD,PENNY
3019,"You know, I like harp lessons, but I’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?",OTHERS,HOWARD
3020,It’s an experiment.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3021,Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.,PENNY,SHELDON
3022,"Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.",RAJ,LEONARD
3023,"You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3024,So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3025,"So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.",OTHERS,PENNY
3026,Wait. They might be hostile.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3027,So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.,PENNY,OTHERS
3028,You could have offered me a ride home.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3029,A little. They’re very old-fashioned.,OTHERS,RAJ
3030,"It’s on, bitch.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3031,"There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3032,"Well, I feel closer to you now.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3033,"One on top, one on the bottom.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3034,"Well, guess I’m ready to go.",OTHERS,PENNY
3035,"Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3036,"You didn’t break up, she dumped you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3037,"Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3038,You’re tying my hands here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3039,"You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3040,"Goodbye Penny.  Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!",SHELDON,SHELDON
3041,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3042,"I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3043,Just go.,PENNY,LEONARD
3044,"No, uh, no, I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?",SHELDON,PENNY
3045,And you’re going to stay calm?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3046,"And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3047,"Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3048,"Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3049,"Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…",RAJ,PENNY
3050,"No, not a thing.",RAJ,LEONARD
3051,She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.,RAJ,RAJ
3052,I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.,PENNY,SHELDON
3053,"So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?",SHELDON,RAJ
3054,"You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3055,I will always have the dent to remember it by.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3056,You’re welcome. Good night.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3057,How was the hospital?,RAJ,SHELDON
3058,"That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3059,"Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3060,"So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?",LEONARD,RAJ
3061,"And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.",RAJ,RAJ
3062,Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3063,That’s not very nice.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3064,"Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3065,What’s going on?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3066,"So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3067,Don’t thank me. You earned it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3068,"For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous.",OTHERS,PENNY
3069,"It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.",PENNY,PENNY
3070,"Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3071,Perfectly formed miniature human being.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3072,Really?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3073,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
3074,Wow. What did you tell them?,RAJ,PENNY
3075,"Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3076,Are you gonna say hi to him?,OTHERS,PENNY
3077,"I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3078,"Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.",RAJ,SHELDON
3079,"So, was the fight really bad?",PENNY,PENNY
3080,"Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3081,"Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3082,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3083,So what am I supposed to do now?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3084,"I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?",RAJ,SHELDON
3085,No. Why?,LEONARD,LEONARD

3087,That’s the one.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3088,Really? Why is that?,PENNY,PENNY
3089,"Trust me, it doesn’t.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3090,"So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?",RAJ,PENNY
3091,Cool. How do they do that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3092,"Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?",LEONARD,PENNY
3093,No.,RAJ,LEONARD
3094,"Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…",SHELDON,PENNY
3095,I don’t know. What’s the difference?,LEONARD,PENNY
3096,I will. I will!,OTHERS,SHELDON
3097,My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.,HOWARD,SHELDON

3099,How’s it going?,PENNY,LEONARD
3100,"Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.",PENNY,PENNY
3101,Well it’s not.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3102,Well…,LEONARD,LEONARD
3103,“Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3104,He might not be.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3105,We’re heading out for some kite fighting.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3106,"Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3107,"Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3108,What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3109,My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3110,"Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3111,"You should just talk to him, I’m sure you guys can work this out.",PENNY,LEONARD
3112,Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3113,Are we done?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3114,I’ll miss you more.,HOWARD,OTHERS
3115,"Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3116,I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3117,Who wants some more coffee?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3118,"Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m totally okay with it.",PENNY,PENNY
3119,"Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon’s upset.",RAJ,PENNY

3169,Pantsuits suck.,PENNY,LEONARD
3170,I’ll be right back.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3171,"Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3172,Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.,OTHERS,LEONARD

3174,Excellent! What are you planning to wear?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3175,Do you have this one?,OTHERS,LEONARD

3243,"So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3244,"Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3245,"It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.",RAJ,RAJ

3273,Name it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3274,Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3275,"Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3276,"Yeah, so?",HOWARD,LEONARD
3277,"So, when can we get rid of it?",SHELDON,LEONARD
3278,"Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team.",OTHERS,SHELDON

3290,"All right, guys, what game do you want to play?",RAJ,PENNY
3291,He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.,SHELDON,SHELDON

3319,Want a cup of coffee?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3320,Anybody home?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3321,"All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.",LEONARD,PENNY
3322,"Okay, like usual. Good.",LEONARD,PENNY

3337,That someone has a name.,LEONARD,SHELDON

3521,Terrific.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3522,"Yeah, I do.. As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!",SHELDON,SHELDON

3533,Is it working?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3534,Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?,OTHERS,PENNY

3543,"No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you’re on your own.",OTHERS,SHELDON

3548,"Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!",SHELDON,SHELDON

3558,Guess.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3559,What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3560,"Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?",LEONARD,HOWARD
3561,"Uh, Sheldon?",LEONARD,PENNY
3562,I bet she did and you didn’t listen.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3563,"All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?",SHELDON,HOWARD

3565,"No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3566,Or nobody calls anyone.,LEONARD,LEONARD

3582,"But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!",RAJ,PENNY

3607,Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.,OTHERS,SHELDON

3609,What?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3610,"No, but Sheldon told me all about it. He told everybody.",OTHERS,PENNY
3611,Sheldon.,PENNY,LEONARD

3618,Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.,RAJ,SHELDON

3623,"Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?",SHELDON,SHELDON

3629,Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3630,He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?,SHELDON,SHELDON

3633,I hate this guy.,LEONARD,LEONARD

3636,"Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever.",LEONARD,PENNY
3637,More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!,HOWARD,SHELDON
3638,"But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3639,"You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?",SHELDON,SHELDON

3647,"Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?",OTHERS,PENNY
3648,"So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?",OTHERS,HOWARD

3652,Okay.,RAJ,PENNY
3653,"Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3654,It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.,RAJ,SHELDON
3655,"Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3656,"Again, I’m sorry.",PENNY,LEONARD
3657,Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?,OTHERS,OTHERS
3658,In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.,PENNY,LEONARD
3659,"Oh, pthththth.",PENNY,SHELDON
3660,"I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3661,"Let’s see.  Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3662,"Well, that’s not your fault.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3663,"Yeah, he really is.",PENNY,PENNY
3664,"We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3665,"All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?",RAJ,SHELDON
3666,Maybe slapped with a fine.,RAJ,LEONARD
3667,All right.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3668,Got it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3669,"Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3670,Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3671,"Sheldon, take a break.",PENNY,LEONARD
3672,Come here.,PENNY,LEONARD
3673,"Howard, do something.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3674,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3675,When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3676,Some people go outside and do that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3677,"Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3678,Why?,PENNY,LEONARD
3679,"Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?",RAJ,PENNY
3680,"Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.",LEONARD,PENNY
3681,Thank you.,PENNY,SHELDON
3682,"I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming.  Ow! Aw.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3683,"Oh, that sounds like fun.",OTHERS,PENNY
3684,"There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.",SHELDON,RAJ
3685,I have an alternate proposal.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3686,Why not?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3687,What’s that?,RAJ,PENNY
3688,"Gather round, kids, it’s time for Sheldon’s beloved Christmas special.",HOWARD,OTHERS
3689,I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.,OTHERS,HOWARD
3690,"We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3691,Mmm.,PENNY,LEONARD
3692,"Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.",OTHERS,PENNY
3693,"Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3694,You don’t have buffets in India?,LEONARD,RAJ
3695,"Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?",PENNY,PENNY
3696,"These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3697,I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3698,You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.,SHELDON,RAJ
3699,"Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3700,"No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3701,"Good night, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3702,"Never, that’s the problem. I need your help.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3703,"Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3704,"Well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?",RAJ,HOWARD
3705,"Yeah, I guess.",PENNY,LEONARD
3706,Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3707,From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?,LEONARD,OTHERS
3708,"Uh, Sheldon?",LEONARD,PENNY
3709,Of course not. I’ll have my usual.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3710,"And how do you propose to do that?  Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3711,"I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.",OTHERS,PENNY
3712,"Me, too.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3713,Ew!,HOWARD,PENNY
3714,"And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.",PENNY,HOWARD
3715,"I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3716,"A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3717,Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3718,"Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar.",HOWARD,PENNY
3719,"Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3720,"What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?",HOWARD,LEONARD
3721,"Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3722,That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3723,"When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3724,"Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive.",LEONARD,RAJ
3725,It’s exactly the same…,PENNY,SHELDON
3726,"Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook.",LEONARD,PENNY
3727,I’ll go get him.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3728,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3729,Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…,SHELDON,LEONARD
3730,We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3731,Ow!,LEONARD,LEONARD
3732,"No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3733,There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3734,With a beautiful girl on your arm.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3735,"You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3736,"Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.",RAJ,RAJ
3737,"Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush.",LEONARD,PENNY
3738,"All right. Well, I’ll see you around.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3739,So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3740,"You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3741,"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I’d have better luck making friends if I wait ’til the Cylons take over? Please.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3742,"Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3743,"Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?",PENNY,PENNY
3744,"Um, little bit.  What?",LEONARD,PENNY
3745,Why?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3746,What smells so good?,OTHERS,OTHERS
3747,"So, business in the front, science in the back.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3748,"No, no, Penny, don’t dismiss his feelings.",RAJ,SHELDON
3749,"Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!",RAJ,HOWARD
3750,What was all that about?,RAJ,LEONARD
3751,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
3752,"Okay, thankyou.",PENNY,PENNY
3753,Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3754,"Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain.",PENNY,HOWARD
3755,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3756,Wow.,LEONARD,PENNY
3757,"Sure, no problem.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3758,I’m sorry. What do we know?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3759,"Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3760,"Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.",LEONARD,PENNY
3761,"I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3762,And that didn’t bother you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3763,"Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.",LEONARD,PENNY
3764,Literally? Literally a million years?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3765,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
3766,"Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3767,Why would she move out? It’s her house.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3768,I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3769,"I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?",OTHERS,SHELDON
3770,Damn it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3771,You! Always bet on black.,RAJ,RAJ
3772,Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.,OTHERS,HOWARD
3773,I liked the time travel element.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3774,"Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?",PENNY,PENNY
3775,"You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.",HOWARD,PENNY
3776,She seems nice.,LEONARD,OTHERS
3777,"I mean, I like a little brown sugar.",PENNY,PENNY
3778,I don’t know Morse code.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3779,"Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3780,"Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3781,"Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.",PENNY,SHELDON
3782,"You’re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3783,There’s no way this is sixty feet.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3784,"I don’t know what to do. I mean, the paper’s terrible. But if I tell her, she’ll know that I read it and she’ll get really mad.",LEONARD,PENNY
3785,"Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3786,"Oh, it’s so exciting.",OTHERS,PENNY
3787,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
3788,"Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?",LEONARD,RAJ
3789,"Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3790,"Well, sleep tight.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3791,Oh.,PENNY,PENNY
3792,"I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3793,"What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3794,I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3795,Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3796,"Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?",LEONARD,PENNY
3797,"Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?",PENNY,PENNY
3798,This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.,PENNY,SHELDON
3799,"Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America’s top models.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3800,"You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3801,All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3802,I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3803,Hi.,OTHERS,PENNY
3804,What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?,PENNY,RAJ
3805,"Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring.",LEONARD,PENNY
3806,"Oh, hi.",HOWARD,PENNY
3807,Leonard.,PENNY,SHELDON
3808,It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.,SHELDON,HOWARD
3809,"Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.",PENNY,PENNY
3810,Could be somewhere else.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3811,"Yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh….",SHELDON,SHELDON
3812,"Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.",OTHERS,RAJ
3813,At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3814,"What?  Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.",PENNY,PENNY
3815,Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3816,Give me the eraser.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3817,Hi. You guys have a minute?,PENNY,PENNY
3818,Still haven’t heard from her?,PENNY,LEONARD
3819,"Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her.",LEONARD,PENNY
3820,"Fun, I’ve never been there.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3821,"A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3822,"Actually, I think he’s onto something.",PENNY,LEONARD
3823,"Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.",LEONARD,PENNY
3824,"I’m done, anybody else?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3825,"You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3826,"Okay, I think that’s enough about me.",HOWARD,PENNY
3827,What the hell? What’s the matter?,LEONARD,PENNY
3828,"Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3829,"Well, think about it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3830,We have time now. Think about it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3831,"Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3832,"Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3833,Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3834,I hardly think so.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3835,"I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3836,"Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.",PENNY,PENNY
3837,Who are you texting?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3838,"The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?",PENNY,LEONARD
3839,That’s a lot of money for only one colour.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3840,Sure. Let go of the ring.,RAJ,HOWARD
3841,"Yup, we’re killin’ it.",OTHERS,PENNY
3842,"Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3843,"Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?",PENNY,HOWARD
3844,It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3845,"Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.",LEONARD,PENNY
3846,"Leonard, a moment.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3847,"Well, did you tell him that?",PENNY,PENNY
3848,"Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.",PENNY,PENNY
3849,Yeah. I’m terrific.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3850,I’m sorry I yelled at you. It’s not your fault.,PENNY,SHELDON
3851,It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?,OTHERS,RAJ
3852,"No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3853,"Oh, please, don’t do that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3854,We’ll talk about this later.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3855,Curse you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3856,He had Lysine but changed it.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3857,Then let go of the ring and walk away.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3858,You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3859,"Oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window.",PENNY,PENNY
3860,Can I get you anything?,LEONARD,OTHERS
3861,"Well, you didn’t specify.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3862,I agree.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3863,I thought that was gonna break the other way.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3864,Are you going to let me tell the story or not?,RAJ,SHELDON
3865,"Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?",PENNY,PENNY
3866,You’re kidding.,PENNY,LEONARD
3867,"That’s right, okay, Raj can play for me.",HOWARD,PENNY
3868,Glad we cleared that up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3869,Intriguing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3870,"Hey, look who’s here! Hey, buddies!",OTHERS,HOWARD
3871,"Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?",PENNY,PENNY
3872,"Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3873,I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.,RAJ,LEONARD
3874,"Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3875,Five?,PENNY,LEONARD
3876,Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?,HOWARD,PENNY
3877,"Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3878,"Oh, please?",RAJ,SHELDON
3879,I was thinking here with you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3880,"You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.",RAJ,HOWARD
3881,"That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3882,They are not.,LEONARD,LEONARD

3884,Did it work?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3885,"I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3886,It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3887,"Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3888,Why?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3889,That is not the definition of professional.,PENNY,SHELDON
3890,"Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3891,"Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3892,"Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you’re Bogarding the symposium.",HOWARD,SHELDON

3894,"Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.",PENNY,PENNY
3895,I’m gonna go hit the bar.,HOWARD,PENNY
3896,No.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3897,Sorry.,PENNY,LEONARD
3898,He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.,RAJ,SHELDON
3899,You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3900,Why?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3901,"Hi, Dad.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3902,"Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.",PENNY,HOWARD
3903,We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.,LEONARD,RAJ
3904,Oh.,PENNY,PENNY
3905,Great.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3906,"Well, choose.",PENNY,SHELDON
3907,There’s no music.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3908,We’re gonna write an application…,LEONARD,LEONARD
3909,I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3910,He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?,HOWARD,HOWARD

3912,"It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.  Stars are pretty, aren’t they?",RAJ,RAJ
3913,Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3914,"Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…",SHELDON,SHELDON
3915,"You’re never going to let that go, are you?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3916,Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3917,That’s great.,RAJ,LEONARD
3918,So I’m like a bran muffin.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3919,"Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.",RAJ,PENNY
3920,To the tar pits.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3921,And I am not your lady.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3922,"Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.",OTHERS,PENNY
3923,"Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?",RAJ,PENNY
3924,"Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now.",PENNY,HOWARD
3925,"Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.",SHELDON,SHELDON

3929,A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother’s house.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3930,"That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3931,"No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3932,Really? How could you tell?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3933,"I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?",RAJ,SHELDON
3934,You’re not going to Switzerland!,LEONARD,LEONARD
3935,"But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3936,Did you guys do it?,PENNY,LEONARD
3937,"Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3938,That’s funny. I learned something totally different.,PENNY,PENNY
3939,"All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.",PENNY,PENNY

3946,Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3947,"So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone.

3948,You’re kidding.,HOWARD,LEONARD

3950,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
3951,Yes.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3952,"No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.",SHELDON,RAJ
3953,"Mommy, I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!",SHELDON,HOWARD

3958,"You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3959,Who is it?,LEONARD,SHELDON

3961,"I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.",HOWARD,HOWARD

3977,That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3978,"Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3979,"Well, I ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to…",PENNY,PENNY

4016,Huh… Scrimmage…,LEONARD,LEONARD
4017,I also love you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
4018,No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.,SHELDON,SHELDON

4206,A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.,RAJ,HOWARD
4207,I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she’s so nice with that squeaky little voice.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4208,Oh. That bitch!,OTHERS,PENNY
4209,I’ll give it a shot.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4210,I’ve seen her burp you.,PENNY,HOWARD
4211,"What do you want, Sheldon?",PENNY,LEONARD
4212,I don’t think I want to play a game.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4213,They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.,SHELDON,HOWARD
4214,Bring it in.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4215,I can’t.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4216,"Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4217,"Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4218,Worst Renaissance Fair ever.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4219,"The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4220,"Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?",LEONARD,SHELDON
4221,Why do you hate me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4222,Howard…,LEONARD,LEONARD
4223,Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4224,"No, no, you guys go. Have fun.",HOWARD,PENNY
4225,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4226,How’d you do?,RAJ,LEONARD
4227,Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4228,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4229,"Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.",PENNY,HOWARD
4230,"I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4231,You said you weren’t gonna bring that up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4232,You must be very happy.,LEONARD,OTHERS
4233,Great.,RAJ,LEONARD
4234,"Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4235,"Uh, extra peanut sauce?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4236,"Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.",RAJ,RAJ
4237,So where’s the telescope?,OTHERS,HOWARD
4238,Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4239,Um…,SHELDON,LEONARD
4240,Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?,HOWARD,HOWARD
4241,Sure.,RAJ,LEONARD
4242,Telepathically?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4243,"I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug.",PENNY,LEONARD
4244,"Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4245,Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4246,"Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!",LEONARD,PENNY
4247,Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4248,Thanks for not calling the cops.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4249,I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4250,"What do you want, Sheldon?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4251,"Weiches Kätzchen, warmes Kätzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. Liebes Kätzchen, müdes Kätzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4252,Please don’t say it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4253,I hope everything’s okay.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4254,"I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4255,Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4256,"If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4257,"Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog.",PENNY,PENNY
4258,No.,RAJ,LEONARD
4259,"Yes, I am.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4260,"No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.",PENNY,PENNY
4261,"It never is, is it?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4262,"Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.",LEONARD,PENNY
4263,I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.,PENNY,SHELDON
4264,"Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime.",PENNY,PENNY
4265,"Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4266,And you love the sound of your own voice.,HOWARD,OTHERS
4267,You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4268,"I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?",RAJ,SHELDON
4269,"Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4270,Hello?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4271,"Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.",LEONARD,PENNY
4272,I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?,RAJ,LEONARD
4273,"Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.",RAJ,HOWARD
4274,"Well, go ask Leonard.",PENNY,PENNY
4275,I’m so lonely.,RAJ,RAJ
4276,You don’t know?,PENNY,PENNY
4277,It means he is special and smart and nice and…,PENNY,LEONARD
4278,"What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?",OTHERS,RAJ
4279,"Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4280,"It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4281,"Oh, my God, that’s awful.",OTHERS,PENNY
4282,"Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.",SHELDON,PENNY
4283,We looked great.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4284,On the floor.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4285,You’ve got to get me out of this.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4286,I didn’t notice.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4287,"Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4288,"Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.",RAJ,HOWARD
4289,"Oh, thank you, Beverly.",PENNY,SHELDON
4290,I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4291,"No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4292,Do you think this is in poor taste?,HOWARD,SHELDON
4293,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4294,I honestly don’t.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4295,"Well, good for you. Come on in.",PENNY,PENNY
4296,"So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4297,That’s how I’m going to make it look.,LEONARD,OTHERS
4298,"Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.",RAJ,PENNY
4299,Hit me.,PENNY,SHELDON
4300,I’m pushing play.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4301,"Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to.",SHELDON,RAJ
4302,"You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.",SHELDON,RAJ
4303,You hypocrite!,SHELDON,SHELDON
4304,Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4305,"On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4306,"Yeah, but they’re so expensive.",HOWARD,PENNY
4307,"Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.",PENNY,LEONARD
4308,"No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4309,"Well, let’s go find out who.",PENNY,PENNY
4310,You did not just quote an Nsync song.,PENNY,SHELDON
4311,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4312,Why would I do that?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4313,Such a sweet boy for asking. Can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.,OTHERS,RAJ
4314,"Okay, feeling the awkward now.",PENNY,PENNY
4315,"Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4316,I may have a better way that you can teach me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4317,Fine. How was your day?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4318,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4319,"I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4320,"Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?",LEONARD,SHELDON
4321,Yes.,RAJ,LEONARD
4322,"I mean, not me, I’ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4323,I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4324,Do you need any help in the kitchen?,OTHERS,OTHERS
4325,"It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…",HOWARD,HOWARD
4326,"Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4327,What happened?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4328,"I guess, technically, that was my fault.  I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4329,"I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking",LEONARD,LEONARD
4330,"It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4331,You take it easy! I need to use your shower.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4332,"Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  I’m gonna need more force.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4333,You know which yoghurt I mean.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4334,"Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet.",PENNY,PENNY
4335,Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4336,"Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4337,Come on. Click the mouse with me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4338,"Quick, what does a hawk sound like?",SHELDON,HOWARD
4339,All right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4340,"Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?",RAJ,SHELDON
4341,Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4342,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4343,Cut! Take 47.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4344,And he made it all better.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4345,I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.,OTHERS,RAJ
4346,"By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4347,Out with friends.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4348,How long has this been going on?,PENNY,LEONARD
4349,Did it work?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4350,"Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4351,"Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4352,"I’m sorry, what were the choices again?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4353,Okay.,LEONARD,PENNY
4354,"Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4355,"Seriously, I have a great idea for one.",PENNY,LEONARD
4356,"You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4357,To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4358,"Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4359,"Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?",PENNY,SHELDON
4360,"Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4361,"I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4362,But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4363,"Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4364,"And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4365,"Oh, I know. This might help.",LEONARD,PENNY
4366,"You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4367,"Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.",HOWARD,RAJ
4368,"Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4369,Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4370,I’ll figure it out.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4371,Do you want the long answer or the short answer?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4372,"Okay, let’s go.",OTHERS,PENNY
4373,Can I see?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4374,Shut your ass!,RAJ,HOWARD
4375,"No, no, no, I don’t want to.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4376,You’re kidding.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4377,Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.,PENNY,SHELDON
4378,"Oh, God. Amy!",PENNY,PENNY
4379,"So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?",HOWARD,PENNY
4380,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4381,I drank milk that tasted funny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4382,"Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4383,"It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4384,You’re an idiot.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4385,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
4386,World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?,RAJ,RAJ
4387,I didn’t screw it up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4388,Really?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4389,"Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4390,"Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.",PENNY,PENNY
4391,Is Leonard around?,PENNY,PENNY
4392,"All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4393,I suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4394,"Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4395,"Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.",PENNY,PENNY
4396,Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4397,You let go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4398,"Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.",HOWARD,PENNY
4399,"I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4400,What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4401,"I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.",HOWARD,PENNY
4402,Thanks for coming with me.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4403,"That’s what we’re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4404,And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4405,"Okay, I’m going to just go for broke here and say I like you.",HOWARD,PENNY
4406,"Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later.",PENNY,PENNY
4407,"I didn’t come to help, I came to mock.",RAJ,SHELDON
4408,"Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4409,"Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4410,"You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4411,Break a leg.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4412,Aren’t I?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4413,"Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4414,I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4415,I don’t want to talk to Amy.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4416,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
4417,Nah.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4418,Now! Do it!,SHELDON,SHELDON
4419,I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.,LEONARD,PENNY
4420,Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4421,"Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4422,But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?,HOWARD,SHELDON
4423,"Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4424,I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4425,But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4426,"Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4427,"No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4428,"Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?",RAJ,PENNY
4429,This one. Let’s go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4430,Sorry.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4431,It is kind of cute.,SHELDON,PENNY
4432,Not yet.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4433,"I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.",PENNY,PENNY
4434,Nice.,HOWARD,OTHERS
4435,So what’s up?,RAJ,PENNY
4436,"I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4437,"Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4438,Can I have a tissue?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4439,I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4440,I am taking you shopping.,PENNY,LEONARD
4441,They sure did.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4442,"I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.",HOWARD,RAJ
4443,"Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?",PENNY,SHELDON
4444,"Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4445,"Oh, I’ll get that.",PENNY,SHELDON
4446,"No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4447,"Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?",PENNY,SHELDON
4448,"Hang on.  You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.",LEONARD,HOWARD
4449,"Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?",LEONARD,HOWARD
4450,"Vegas, here we come.",PENNY,HOWARD
4451,Bernadette.  Bernadette.  Bernadette.,SHELDON,HOWARD
4452,"Raj, take me home.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4453,Neither do I. But we can find out together.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4454,"Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.",LEONARD,PENNY
4455,"Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.",RAJ,RAJ
4456,"Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?",RAJ,RAJ
4457,So why don’t you get it fixed?,RAJ,LEONARD
4458,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4459,"Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4460,"So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4461,"Crikey, what flag do we have today?",SHELDON,HOWARD
4462,"Well, she moved in across the hall.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4463,What the hell are you doing?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4464,"Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4465,"Yeah. Sure, sure.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4466,And then you got arrested.,PENNY,LEONARD
4467,"Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4468,We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4469,"Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.",RAJ,LEONARD
4470,"For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!",LEONARD,PENNY
4471,Yes! This party just became a major rager.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4472,"You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.",LEONARD,PENNY
4473,It’s too late for me. Save yourself.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4474,I know one way to find out. Sniff this.,PENNY,SHELDON
4475,"I’ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it’s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with…",SHELDON,SHELDON
4476,"Well, which is it, ten or eleven?",PENNY,LEONARD
4477,For what?,PENNY,LEONARD
4478,"Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?",HOWARD,PENNY
4479,Be safe and call us.,PENNY,LEONARD
4480,Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.,RAJ,RAJ
4481,And there is the love of which I speak.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4482,"Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!",LEONARD,LEONARD
4483,"I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4484,"Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?",PENNY,PENNY
4485,"Yeah, that’ll slow it down.",PENNY,LEONARD
4486,Okay. Thank you.,PENNY,PENNY
4487,"I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4488,"That’s not overconfidence, that’s observation.",RAJ,SHELDON
4489,I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4490,"Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.",SHELDON,PENNY
4491,"No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.",RAJ,PENNY
4492,"Leonard, explain it to her.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4493,"Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.",RAJ,HOWARD
4494,"Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4495,Where did you get that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4496,I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4497,I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4498,"Okay, hold on…",PENNY,LEONARD
4499,"Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.",RAJ,PENNY
4500,I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4501,"Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?",RAJ,PENNY
4502,"First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4503,"Okay, that should do it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4504,"Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4505,I got here as quickly as I could.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4506,Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4507,"Oh, gee, thanks.",HOWARD,PENNY
4508,"The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4509,"Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos.",SHELDON,PENNY
4510,I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4511,"Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.",PENNY,PENNY
4512,"Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4513,"I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?",HOWARD,OTHERS
4514,"What do you want, Ma?",HOWARD,HOWARD
4515,Empathetic.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4516,"Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.",RAJ,RAJ
4517,Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4518,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4519,"Oh, that’s a nice offer.",PENNY,PENNY
4520,"Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.",PENNY,PENNY
4521,"Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.",PENNY,SHELDON
4522,"Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4523,"Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.",PENNY,PENNY
4524,"Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.",PENNY,PENNY
4525,What the hell?,PENNY,PENNY
4526,"No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4527,"Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.",HOWARD,PENNY
4528,"I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4529,I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4530,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
4531,"Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great.",RAJ,HOWARD
4532,"In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4533,"Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4534,"Well, that’s hard to hear, but I’ll still take you back.",RAJ,SHELDON
4535,They have a man there who understands my personal style.,SHELDON,RAJ
4536,"He can, but it’s still not changing my mind.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4537,"And, yes, even shed a tear or two.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4538,And bring back the bear.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4539,"How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?",OTHERS,HOWARD
4540,"I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.",RAJ,RAJ
4541,"Okay, I think I understand.",LEONARD,PENNY
4542,And she sent you to get it from me?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4543,"You should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to.",PENNY,LEONARD
4544,Right.   Penny.  Penny.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4545,The horror!,SHELDON,SHELDON

4550,"Yep, it is.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4551,"Yeah, but why are you fat?",RAJ,PENNY
4552,"Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.",LEONARD,PENNY
4553,I’m sad to say I taught him those moves.,HOWARD,OTHERS
4554,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4555,"You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4556,Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4557,"Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4558,Don’t say it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4559,You ready to go?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4560,"Yeah, we could name him Blobert.",HOWARD,HOWARD

4568,Sure. I can hear it in your voice.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4569,"Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels.",HOWARD,HOWARD

4571,"Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4572,"I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4573,I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.,SHELDON,RAJ
4574,Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4575,All right.,PENNY,SHELDON
4576,"Hear, hear.",RAJ,LEONARD
4577,"Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4578,You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.,PENNY,RAJ

4580,"Well, what if we use our vacation time?",HOWARD,SHELDON
4581,"Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4582,"Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.",LEONARD,RAJ
4583,Did you lie to Howard about tonight?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4584,"Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.",RAJ,HOWARD
4585,It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4586,"Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.",PENNY,HOWARD
4587,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4588,We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.,LEONARD,RAJ
4589,That might work too.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4590,"Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.",SHELDON,SHELDON

4604,"Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4605,So you think you should keep it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4606,"I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?",RAJ,SHELDON
4607,I thought Stuart was looking after her.,RAJ,RAJ
4608,Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?,HOWARD,HOWARD
