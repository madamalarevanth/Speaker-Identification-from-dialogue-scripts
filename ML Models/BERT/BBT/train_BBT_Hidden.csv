129,We were having a conversation about past lovers.,RAJ,SHELDON
130,Just what?,OTHERS,SHELDON
131,"Oh, the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the  I used the  And then I  And that did it.  Wow, I wonder what they’re redacting.",SHELDON,OTHERS

165,What?,LEONARD,HOWARD
166,"I’ll show you.  Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys.

Nope.",SHELDON,PENNY
167,I knew that too.,LEONARD,LEONARD

191,Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.,OTHERS,LEONARD
192,All set.,SHELDON,PENNY

196,I didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.,HOWARD,LEONARD
197,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.",SHELDON,LEONARD
198,And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.,SHELDON,SHELDON
199,"Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.",RAJ,SHELDON
200,Maybe this time he’s going to do it.,RAJ,LEONARD

209,"You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?",OTHERS,LEONARD
210,Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.,OTHERS,SHELDON
211,This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.,PENNY,SHELDON
212,It’s fusion.,PENNY,LEONARD

215,What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you.,HOWARD,PENNY
216,"Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?",OTHERS,PENNY
217,Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.,LEONARD,LEONARD

219,He sounds like a sociopath.,SHELDON,HOWARD

229,"Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?",SHELDON,LEONARD
230,We were hoping you’d know a place.,OTHERS,RAJ

232,How did she know it was us?,LEONARD,SHELDON
233,Hi!,LEONARD,SHELDON
234,Why don’t we share it? We’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.,HOWARD,LEONARD
235,"Uh, well, it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.",PENNY,HOWARD
236,"So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?",HOWARD,SHELDON
237,"Yeah, sorry.",LEONARD,RAJ
238,"So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?",LEONARD,PENNY

245,"I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.",OTHERS,PENNY
246,"I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.",PENNY,SHELDON

278,They texted me.,LEONARD,PENNY
279,Outside? I just made cocoa.,SHELDON,LEONARD

302,"And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.",LEONARD,SHELDON
303,"Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.",PENNY,SHELDON
304,"Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.",LEONARD,SHELDON
305,Screwed.,SHELDON,LEONARD
306,"That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.",SHELDON,PENNY
307,"Wait, twice?",LEONARD,SHELDON
308,"Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.",OTHERS,LEONARD
309,"Actually, we met online.",SHELDON,LEONARD
310,"For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!",LEONARD,SHELDON
311,"Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?",SHELDON,SHELDON
312,Not in these pants.,SHELDON,SHELDON
313,"Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.",HOWARD,HOWARD
314,"So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?",PENNY,SHELDON
315,"And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially.",HOWARD,SHELDON
316,"I do, of course I do.",LEONARD,SHELDON
317,"What are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?",RAJ,LEONARD
318,Now what?,HOWARD,PENNY
319,"I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.",PENNY,PENNY
320,"Wait, my laptop.",RAJ,PENNY
321,What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?,OTHERS,SHELDON
322,We’re so sorry.,OTHERS,SHELDON
323,Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.,SHELDON,LEONARD
324,"Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!",SHELDON,SHELDON
325,"Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail.",LEONARD,PENNY
326,Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.,RAJ,LEONARD
327,See you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
328,"No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.",PENNY,PENNY
329,"That’s it, that’s the line.",LEONARD,SHELDON
330,"Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run.",OTHERS,SHELDON
331,But I worked hard to get this armour.,HOWARD,PENNY
332,Let’s get you to the hospital.,LEONARD,SHELDON
333,"Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.",LEONARD,OTHERS
334,"If you’d like, we can help you out.",HOWARD,SHELDON
335,I love that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
336,"Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?",HOWARD,HOWARD
337,I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.,OTHERS,SHELDON
338,I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back.,OTHERS,SHELDON
339,Dr. Hofstadter.,SHELDON,LEONARD
340,"Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.",SHELDON,SHELDON
341,Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?,SHELDON,RAJ
342,It’s all of ours.,RAJ,OTHERS
343,House? What house?,HOWARD,SHELDON
344,It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.,RAJ,LEONARD
345,"Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.",SHELDON,HOWARD
346,She does. 42 minutes in.,SHELDON,HOWARD
347,Can I stay here tonight?,OTHERS,PENNY
348,"Ooh, you just chose champions. It’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.",OTHERS,LEONARD
349,"Actually, I did get you something.",OTHERS,RAJ
350,But I used science to construct the perfect joke.,SHELDON,LEONARD
351,No kidding.,LEONARD,SHELDON
352,That was kind of uncalled for.,OTHERS,PENNY
353,He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.,OTHERS,PENNY
354,"You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.",RAJ,SHELDON
355,"Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?",OTHERS,SHELDON
356,"Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.",RAJ,LEONARD
357,Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?,PENNY,HOWARD
358,Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?,OTHERS,RAJ
359,"I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.",RAJ,PENNY
360,"Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…",OTHERS,SHELDON
361,"Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.",LEONARD,SHELDON
362,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers.",SHELDON,HOWARD
363,I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.,HOWARD,OTHERS
364,Ow. That was your fault.,SHELDON,PENNY
365,I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.,LEONARD,PENNY
366,"Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee.  Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.",OTHERS,SHELDON
367,"For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing.",SHELDON,HOWARD
368,I always catch your drift.,OTHERS,SHELDON
369,Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?,LEONARD,SHELDON
370,I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.,OTHERS,SHELDON
371,"And just so you know, it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable.",RAJ,RAJ
372,"Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.",RAJ,LEONARD
373,But the movie did just get good.,HOWARD,LEONARD
374,And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.,LEONARD,PENNY
375,I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.,SHELDON,SHELDON
376,"Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too.",SHELDON,OTHERS
377,What?,PENNY,PENNY
378,Okay.,HOWARD,SHELDON
379,I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.,SHELDON,SHELDON
380,233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.,SHELDON,HOWARD
381,"As long as we’re apologising, Sheldon, I, I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.",RAJ,SHELDON
382,"Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
383,I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.,OTHERS,LEONARD
384,"Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.",LEONARD,LEONARD
385,Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?,OTHERS,SHELDON
386,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
387,"Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?",SHELDON,LEONARD
388,Who’s that?,PENNY,SHELDON
389,First take a picture with me.,HOWARD,PENNY
390,"No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?",SHELDON,LEONARD
391,I’m sure it’s lovable.,OTHERS,SHELDON
392,He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.,OTHERS,PENNY
393,"Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?",HOWARD,PENNY
394,"Oh, good. Context.",LEONARD,SHELDON
395,"Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.",LEONARD,SHELDON
396,"I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest.",OTHERS,SHELDON
397,I believe it was your turn in the game.,SHELDON,OTHERS
398,"Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?",SHELDON,PENNY
399,"I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They’re both adults.",RAJ,SHELDON
400,"Oh, it’s fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase.",SHELDON,LEONARD
401,Okay.,LEONARD,LEONARD
402,He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.,HOWARD,SHELDON
403,Night.,PENNY,LEONARD
404,"What, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?",HOWARD,LEONARD
405,Comic book store.,LEONARD,SHELDON
406,Should’ve let Sheldon come.,LEONARD,LEONARD
407,Just give me the box.,OTHERS,PENNY
408,What’s your formula for the corner.,SHELDON,PENNY
409,Let’s go.,OTHERS,HOWARD
410,Milk Dud?,SHELDON,PENNY
411,"Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.",SHELDON,SHELDON
412,"Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?",SHELDON,HOWARD
413,I do like the X-Men.,SHELDON,LEONARD
414,"Okay, you’re kind of really great.",PENNY,LEONARD
415,No.,SHELDON,PENNY
416,Is my hamburger medium well?,SHELDON,SHELDON
417,"Well, that’s sweet. I bet you’ll have fun.",OTHERS,LEONARD
418,"Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.",LEONARD,LEONARD
419,"Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?",OTHERS,LEONARD
420,Oh.,HOWARD,HOWARD
421,Like you and your dog.,HOWARD,SHELDON
422,What does it say?,SHELDON,LEONARD
423,"Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?",LEONARD,LEONARD
424,"Yes, sir.",LEONARD,SHELDON
425,"And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!",SHELDON,LEONARD
426,"He’s probably busy. You’re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I’m sure he’ll play, and you’ll see that everything’s fine. My turn. I can’t let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it’s bad without letting her know that I read it?",LEONARD,SHELDON
427,"Well, um, on one level, really, really well.",LEONARD,SHELDON
428,"Who, me?",PENNY,LEONARD
429,"I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic",SHELDON,LEONARD
430,Great. Here I am!,OTHERS,PENNY
431,"It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.",LEONARD,SHELDON
432,"Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…",SHELDON,LEONARD
433,"Oh, no. What have I done?",SHELDON,LEONARD
434,Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.,LEONARD,PENNY
435,"Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.",HOWARD,SHELDON
436,I think I hate all of you nerds.,PENNY,SHELDON
437,"It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you.",LEONARD,HOWARD
438,Colour’s fine.,HOWARD,SHELDON
439,"No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.",LEONARD,LEONARD
440,"If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.",LEONARD,RAJ
441,That does seem to be a valid principle.,OTHERS,RAJ
442,"Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women.",HOWARD,PENNY
443,"Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.",OTHERS,HOWARD
444,Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment.,HOWARD,SHELDON
445,I don’t think it worked.,SHELDON,LEONARD
446,"Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.",OTHERS,LEONARD
447,Sheldon.,LEONARD,PENNY
448,"No, I’m waiting till he’s in a good mood.",OTHERS,SHELDON
449,Mm-hmm.,LEONARD,SHELDON
450,A tribe of Abra-Comanches.,LEONARD,PENNY
451,"Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.",OTHERS,LEONARD
452,You know what? I don’t want to deal with this right now.,OTHERS,SHELDON
453,I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.,SHELDON,PENNY
454,We got to get out of here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
455,I won’t.,OTHERS,RAJ
456,"Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?",SHELDON,LEONARD
457,"Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship.",LEONARD,SHELDON
458,She’s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.,OTHERS,SHELDON
459,Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.,SHELDON,SHELDON
460,You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.,SHELDON,SHELDON
461,"Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.",OTHERS,SHELDON
462,"Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.",PENNY,LEONARD
463,I will. Excuse me.,LEONARD,HOWARD
464,"As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?",RAJ,PENNY
465,Why?,HOWARD,LEONARD
466,"Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?",RAJ,SHELDON
467,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
468,Okay.,RAJ,HOWARD
469,The end.,LEONARD,HOWARD
470,Howie.,OTHERS,PENNY
471,"Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car.",HOWARD,LEONARD
472,That pan had to soak and you know it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
473,Okay…,LEONARD,LEONARD
474,How could you? We had a pact!,HOWARD,SHELDON
475,Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.,HOWARD,SHELDON
476,"Okay, lady, you are way out of line.",PENNY,RAJ
477,How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?,PENNY,LEONARD
478,Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.,PENNY,HOWARD
479,"My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.",SHELDON,OTHERS
480,I didn’t ask for your permission.,OTHERS,LEONARD
481,"It’s just where I need them. You know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space.",LEONARD,SHELDON
482,"Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.",HOWARD,RAJ
483,But it is what you got me last year.,LEONARD,PENNY
484,"Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?",SHELDON,RAJ
485,What do you say?,LEONARD,LEONARD
486,"Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.",PENNY,SHELDON
487,Hi.,HOWARD,LEONARD
488,"What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?",PENNY,SHELDON
489,Oh. What are you doing here?,OTHERS,SHELDON
490,"Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.",SHELDON,PENNY
491,She’s been in there a long time.,OTHERS,SHELDON
492,What are you talking about?,PENNY,SHELDON
493,You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?,SHELDON,SHELDON
494,"Oh, thanks, man.",RAJ,LEONARD
495,Fine.,LEONARD,PENNY
496,What’s that like?,OTHERS,HOWARD
497,"Double potion, please.",LEONARD,OTHERS
498,"It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
499,Who’s going to officiate?,OTHERS,SHELDON
500,"Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses.",LEONARD,SHELDON
501,What’s classified?,PENNY,LEONARD
502,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
503,Not us. Him.,HOWARD,SHELDON
504,"Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.",RAJ,PENNY
505,"No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.",PENNY,PENNY
506,I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.,RAJ,LEONARD
507,We’ll be there.,HOWARD,SHELDON
508,"It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.",SHELDON,SHELDON
509,"Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?",RAJ,LEONARD
510,"Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?",LEONARD,PENNY
511,"Yeah, maybe your dad’s right.",OTHERS,SHELDON
512,"Okay, wait. What are we doing?",PENNY,SHELDON
513,But it’s frozen.,HOWARD,OTHERS
514,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.",LEONARD,PENNY
515,"Hey, Raj. if Howard can’t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?",OTHERS,LEONARD
516,"By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.",HOWARD,HOWARD
517,Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?,LEONARD,LEONARD
518,Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.,RAJ,PENNY
519,Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?,PENNY,PENNY
520,He did.,SHELDON,HOWARD
521,"Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.",PENNY,LEONARD
522,"You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.",PENNY,SHELDON
523,Raj.,HOWARD,SHELDON
524,Why don’t you let me do this.,SHELDON,SHELDON
525,"He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original Norse God.",HOWARD,SHELDON
526,"Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?",LEONARD,LEONARD
527,"Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?",OTHERS,LEONARD
528,Your house?,LEONARD,SHELDON
529,"Well, how do we do that?",HOWARD,LEONARD
530,"Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.",PENNY,LEONARD
531,I broke up with Rebecca.,OTHERS,SHELDON
532,What?,LEONARD,OTHERS
533,Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.,HOWARD,RAJ
534,Here comes Kripke!,RAJ,SHELDON
535,"Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
536,Should we go back and rescue him?,OTHERS,SHELDON
537,"Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?",HOWARD,PENNY
538,I don’t know. Sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.,OTHERS,SHELDON
539,"Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.",SHELDON,HOWARD
540,"You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.",OTHERS,SHELDON
541,Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.,OTHERS,PENNY
542,"Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.",LEONARD,HOWARD
543,"No, wait! I have a speech.",SHELDON,RAJ
544,Fine.,OTHERS,RAJ
545,Somebody else do it.,LEONARD,PENNY
546,"Hey, how come we never get that option?",HOWARD,LEONARD
547,One top secret quantum guidance system.,OTHERS,HOWARD
548,What? You gotta be kidding me?,HOWARD,RAJ
549,Why can’t Leonard teach you?,SHELDON,PENNY
550,"Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man.",RAJ,PENNY
551,Hi.,LEONARD,PENNY
552,"Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?",OTHERS,PENNY
553,I like cows.,SHELDON,SHELDON
554,"Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
555,"Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?",OTHERS,SHELDON
556,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
557,I got asked to sign autographs there.,PENNY,LEONARD
558,Here’s the money. Can we do this?,LEONARD,OTHERS
559,I can’t believe you kept this.,LEONARD,LEONARD
560,Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.,OTHERS,LEONARD
561,The living room appears to be empty.,RAJ,LEONARD
562,"Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble.",RAJ,LEONARD
563,It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.,LEONARD,SHELDON
564,I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland.,HOWARD,SHELDON
565,"Howard, let me just stop you right here.",OTHERS,PENNY
566,Howard.,OTHERS,LEONARD
567,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
568,"What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?",SHELDON,SHELDON
569,"Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?",OTHERS,SHELDON
570,That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.,OTHERS,PENNY
571,"Got it. So, can I see you again?",LEONARD,HOWARD
572,That’s not what she meant.,HOWARD,HOWARD
573,Are any of them me?,OTHERS,OTHERS
574,Aw.,PENNY,RAJ
575,Leaking? What’s leaking?,HOWARD,LEONARD
576,"You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.",LEONARD,SHELDON
577,Can I tell her I miss her?,RAJ,RAJ
578,"Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.",LEONARD,LEONARD
579,"Wow, Hawking. Good for you.",PENNY,SHELDON
580,"Ow, it does hurt.",SHELDON,HOWARD
581,"Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.",SHELDON,SHELDON
582,She is gonna break his heart.,HOWARD,SHELDON
583,That is so not true.,RAJ,SHELDON
584,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.",SHELDON,OTHERS
585,"Hey, what’s going on?",LEONARD,LEONARD
586,"Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.",PENNY,OTHERS
587,How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?,SHELDON,OTHERS
588,"With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.",PENNY,LEONARD
589,"Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.",LEONARD,LEONARD
590,Having a little trouble catching your breath there?,PENNY,PENNY
591,Good night.,LEONARD,LEONARD
592,You don’t look okay.,HOWARD,LEONARD
593,He’s pretty cute.,OTHERS,LEONARD
594,"Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act.",SHELDON,OTHERS
595,"No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.",SHELDON,PENNY
596,Please don’t do that.,PENNY,OTHERS
597,"Yeah, that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will.",RAJ,LEONARD
598,It doesn’t need proving.,SHELDON,HOWARD
599,Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.,LEONARD,RAJ
600,You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.,HOWARD,SHELDON
601,"But I answered, it’s called teamwork.",SHELDON,LEONARD
602,What’s George Takei doing here?,OTHERS,SHELDON
603,Because you’re not here.,PENNY,SHELDON
604,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
605,What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?,PENNY,PENNY
606,Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?,PENNY,LEONARD
607,Are you Spock?,RAJ,LEONARD
608,What?,OTHERS,SHELDON
609,Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
610,What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.,OTHERS,LEONARD
611,Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?,PENNY,LEONARD
612,"Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?",OTHERS,SHELDON
613,Don’t you need money?,SHELDON,LEONARD
614,MUON!,SHELDON,LEONARD
615,"Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.",SHELDON,SHELDON
616,"Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.",LEONARD,SHELDON
617,"Well, it’s too late.",RAJ,LEONARD
618,"There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
619,"Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.",PENNY,PENNY
620,"My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
621,"Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.",LEONARD,RAJ
622,GPS?,HOWARD,SHELDON
623,"Come on, I’m sorry.",LEONARD,SHELDON
624,"No, it’s fine. You can ditch away.",LEONARD,SHELDON
625,"Wait, hold on. This is weird.",RAJ,LEONARD
626,I’m Howard.,HOWARD,HOWARD
627,"Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
628,Hi. Want to do yoga with me?,PENNY,SHELDON
629,"Okay, sweetie, I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies, or he’s just gonna say hi, or really what’s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we’ll…",PENNY,PENNY
630,"Okay, well, goodnight.",PENNY,OTHERS
631,"Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.",SHELDON,SHELDON
632,"I know, but why?",SHELDON,SHELDON
633,"Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.",PENNY,LEONARD
634,"Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.",LEONARD,SHELDON
635,"Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.",SHELDON,PENNY
636,"That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
637,Stu the cockatoo?,RAJ,RAJ
638,That’s not really necessary.,HOWARD,LEONARD
639,I doubt it.,LEONARD,PENNY
640,"Hey, Penny. How was work?",LEONARD,LEONARD
641,"Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?",PENNY,LEONARD
642,"I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.",SHELDON,PENNY
643,Um…,OTHERS,LEONARD
644,We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.,RAJ,PENNY
645,"No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers.",LEONARD,SHELDON
646,So what the hell happened?,HOWARD,SHELDON
647,I’m just not really in the mood anymore.,PENNY,SHELDON
648,"Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.",PENNY,LEONARD
649,I can get us there in two.,OTHERS,PENNY
650,Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.,SHELDON,RAJ
651,Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?,LEONARD,SHELDON
652,"All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you’re sad to see him go. I’m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That’s your cue.",PENNY,LEONARD
653,"Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?",RAJ,PENNY
654,"A little loud, dude.",RAJ,SHELDON
655,Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.,HOWARD,LEONARD
656,"Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.",LEONARD,LEONARD
657,"You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.",HOWARD,LEONARD
658,"Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.",HOWARD,PENNY
659,"All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?",SHELDON,PENNY
660,To friendship.,RAJ,SHELDON
661,"Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.",OTHERS,SHELDON
662,"He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…",LEONARD,LEONARD
663,Did you feel guilty?,PENNY,SHELDON
664,Good luck catching a man with that attitude.,LEONARD,PENNY
665,"All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.",LEONARD,PENNY
666,"It’s a tradition of my people.  If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.",HOWARD,LEONARD
667,You’re going up Euclid Avenue?,SHELDON,SHELDON
668,"All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.",SHELDON,SHELDON
669,"There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.",LEONARD,SHELDON
670,Why? What happened?,OTHERS,PENNY
671,"Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?",PENNY,SHELDON
672,"So, how’d it go?",PENNY,SHELDON
673,It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.,SHELDON,LEONARD
674,"One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.",RAJ,LEONARD
675,"Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.",LEONARD,PENNY
676,"Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.",LEONARD,SHELDON
677,Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.,HOWARD,PENNY
678,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?",LEONARD,LEONARD
679,I know exactly what we are gonna do.,LEONARD,PENNY
680,That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?,LEONARD,PENNY
681,It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?,SHELDON,SHELDON
682,"Oh, good, I hate her.",PENNY,PENNY
683,"That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?",SHELDON,HOWARD
684,Why?,PENNY,SHELDON
685,Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…,HOWARD,SHELDON
686,"Now, honey, it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return.",PENNY,SHELDON
687,"I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up.",OTHERS,OTHERS
688,"Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.",LEONARD,PENNY
689,"Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.",RAJ,SHELDON
690,"Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?",SHELDON,SHELDON
691,"Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!",PENNY,PENNY
692,That’s outrageous.,OTHERS,HOWARD
693,"I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?",PENNY,HOWARD
694,Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.,HOWARD,LEONARD
695,"Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?",SHELDON,LEONARD
696,"Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.",RAJ,SHELDON
697,"Oh, that poor waiter.",LEONARD,LEONARD
698,And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
699,Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter.,LEONARD,LEONARD
700,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
701,"Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.",SHELDON,HOWARD
702,"Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
703,Thank you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
704,"Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.",OTHERS,LEONARD
705,"You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.",OTHERS,RAJ
706,"Oh, I’d rather not say.",HOWARD,LEONARD
707,"Wow, excuse me.",PENNY,LEONARD
708,"Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
709,"Oh, well, then you, you do it.",PENNY,SHELDON
710,"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?",SHELDON,SHELDON
711,"What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”",SHELDON,LEONARD
712,"So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?",LEONARD,LEONARD
713,"Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?",SHELDON,PENNY
714,"So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.",LEONARD,PENNY
715,This is really impressive.,PENNY,OTHERS
716,"It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.",RAJ,SHELDON
717,"Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.",RAJ,SHELDON
718,"Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.",OTHERS,LEONARD
719,"Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.",PENNY,SHELDON
720,I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.,OTHERS,LEONARD
721,"Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.",RAJ,PENNY
722,Do not overthink this.,PENNY,HOWARD
723,"Why so glum, chum?",RAJ,LEONARD
724,"Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine.",SHELDON,LEONARD
725,"Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?",PENNY,SHELDON
726,"Bert, Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.",SHELDON,SHELDON
727,Great. What do you do?,LEONARD,LEONARD
728,Thank you. I appreciate that.,RAJ,LEONARD
729,What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?,OTHERS,LEONARD
730,Donated.,OTHERS,OTHERS
731,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.,RAJ,SHELDON
732,That’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.,SHELDON,PENNY
733,"Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.",SHELDON,SHELDON
734,The mysterious subcontinent of India.,RAJ,LEONARD
735,"All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?",PENNY,HOWARD
736,All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.,SHELDON,OTHERS
737,"Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.",SHELDON,OTHERS
738,"Oh, I’ll go. I like a party.",PENNY,SHELDON
739,"No, really, how much?",PENNY,SHELDON
740,"Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…",SHELDON,PENNY
741,I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.,SHELDON,LEONARD
742,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
743,"No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
744,"See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that.",PENNY,SHELDON
745,"Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him.",LEONARD,RAJ
746,"No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.",LEONARD,HOWARD
747,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
748,I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.,HOWARD,SHELDON
749,"Oh, hi.",PENNY,SHELDON
750,"No, no, it’s…",PENNY,LEONARD
751,Okay.,OTHERS,HOWARD
752,"I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?",PENNY,SHELDON
753,You wouldn’t.,SHELDON,SHELDON
754,What is he doing in there?,HOWARD,SHELDON
755,You want to come with us?,HOWARD,SHELDON
756,Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.,OTHERS,LEONARD
757,Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?,RAJ,SHELDON
758,"All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.",SHELDON,HOWARD
759,"No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important.",PENNY,OTHERS
760,"Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.",LEONARD,LEONARD
761,My boyfriend’s a jerk.,OTHERS,LEONARD
762,"You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.",OTHERS,LEONARD
763,"Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
764,"Well, to be truthful…",LEONARD,SHELDON
765,That’s a great idea.,OTHERS,SHELDON
766,"But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.",RAJ,LEONARD
767,I’m not sorry. That’s true.,SHELDON,LEONARD
768,I’m gonna go look for other shoes.,OTHERS,PENNY
769,"Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
770,I’ll go with you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
771,Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.,SHELDON,HOWARD
772,"What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.",LEONARD,PENNY
773,Told ya.,LEONARD,LEONARD
774,"Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?",PENNY,LEONARD
775,I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.,OTHERS,SHELDON
776,"No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.",SHELDON,SHELDON
777,Tea and basketball?,OTHERS,LEONARD
778,Or maybe just stop talking.,OTHERS,SHELDON
779,"No, it’s okay.",OTHERS,LEONARD
780,"Okay, you can have that one.",PENNY,SHELDON
781,"Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.",LEONARD,SHELDON
782,Is that true?,SHELDON,RAJ
783,I hadn’t…,LEONARD,LEONARD
784,"That is true, I have said that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
785,Or just keep dating the possum.,OTHERS,SHELDON
786,Maybe the spot’s the clue.,OTHERS,OTHERS
787,94 seconds.,LEONARD,PENNY
788,"She said no, can we drop it now?",LEONARD,PENNY
789,Out!,HOWARD,SHELDON
790,No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.,SHELDON,PENNY
791,Would you have approved?,SHELDON,LEONARD
792,You heard me. I forbidded it.,RAJ,LEONARD
793,"Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.",HOWARD,LEONARD
794,Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?,SHELDON,HOWARD
795,"Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.",OTHERS,PENNY
796,Sorry.,LEONARD,LEONARD
797,"Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.",PENNY,SHELDON
798,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal….",SHELDON,SHELDON
799,Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.,SHELDON,SHELDON
800,"Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.",LEONARD,SHELDON
801,"Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.",OTHERS,SHELDON
802,Four questions. There answer’s four.,SHELDON,PENNY
803,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.,SHELDON,LEONARD
804,Over half a million dollars.,RAJ,LEONARD
805,"All right, we’re heading out.",PENNY,SHELDON
806,"Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.",LEONARD,PENNY
807,Oh my.,OTHERS,SHELDON
808,They did.,SHELDON,RAJ
809,What would you name him?,RAJ,SHELDON
810,"No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.",PENNY,SHELDON
811,Terrific.,LEONARD,RAJ
812,I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?,SHELDON,PENNY
813,"Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.",LEONARD,RAJ
814,Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.,SHELDON,PENNY
815,"Well, just smile and think about koalas.",PENNY,PENNY
816,"So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?",HOWARD,HOWARD
817,"Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
818,"Damn, there’s always a catch.",RAJ,HOWARD
819,"Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.",PENNY,LEONARD
820,Uh-huh. Look at the comments.,LEONARD,HOWARD
821,"Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.",SHELDON,PENNY
822,"Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.",HOWARD,SHELDON
823,"Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat.",SHELDON,LEONARD
824,"I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it.",RAJ,SHELDON
825,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
826,"Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?",SHELDON,SHELDON
827,I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.,LEONARD,LEONARD
828,"Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
829,I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?,LEONARD,SHELDON
830,I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.,SHELDON,LEONARD
831,Oh. Okay.,LEONARD,SHELDON
832,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
833,"So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?",HOWARD,LEONARD
834,"As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.",SHELDON,LEONARD
835,"No, you see, I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.",RAJ,SHELDON
836,"Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.",PENNY,RAJ
837,Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.,LEONARD,LEONARD
838,"Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.",HOWARD,SHELDON
839,Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.,OTHERS,SHELDON
840,"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.",SHELDON,LEONARD
841,KMN.,PENNY,LEONARD
842,"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.",SHELDON,SHELDON
843,I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.,LEONARD,HOWARD
844,Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.,SHELDON,LEONARD
845,"I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.",OTHERS,HOWARD
846,Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?,OTHERS,PENNY
847,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….",PENNY,LEONARD
848,"Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
849,Or had a single piece of fruit.,SHELDON,SHELDON
850,Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.,LEONARD,SHELDON
851,"You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school.",SHELDON,PENNY
852,"Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do.",PENNY,LEONARD
853,That was supposed to be for the whole floor.,PENNY,SHELDON
854,"Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!",SHELDON,SHELDON
855,"Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?",PENNY,SHELDON
856,"Little bit, yeah.",LEONARD,SHELDON
857,"Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.",PENNY,OTHERS
858,"Boy, it’s good to be back.",PENNY,PENNY
859,"Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.",RAJ,PENNY
860,Six two inch dowels.,LEONARD,LEONARD
861,I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.,LEONARD,SHELDON
862,"Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?",OTHERS,SHELDON
863,"You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.",SHELDON,HOWARD
864,"I’m Barry Kwipke, and I’m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?",OTHERS,LEONARD
865,"No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.",RAJ,LEONARD
866,"Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.",SHELDON,LEONARD
867,That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.,SHELDON,SHELDON
868,"Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.",SHELDON,PENNY
869,I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?,SHELDON,SHELDON
870,"What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?",HOWARD,RAJ
871,This party is just going to suck.,SHELDON,SHELDON
872,"You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.",RAJ,PENNY
873,"All right, I’ll try.",SHELDON,SHELDON
874,"I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?",RAJ,HOWARD
875,"Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!",LEONARD,LEONARD
876,Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.,PENNY,LEONARD
877,I’m getting ready to weigh in again.,OTHERS,LEONARD
878,"Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.",LEONARD,SHELDON
879,Thanks.,OTHERS,HOWARD
880,"Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.",SHELDON,LEONARD
881,"Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it.",HOWARD,RAJ
882,Did Leonard tell you to say that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
883,Leonard said cockamamie?,PENNY,SHELDON
884,"Onion dip, it’s onion dip.",LEONARD,LEONARD
885,Penny? What about her?,LEONARD,HOWARD
886,This contract looks good to me.,HOWARD,SHELDON
887,"If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?",PENNY,SHELDON
888,Oh. I thought it was a game.,SHELDON,OTHERS
889,"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
890,Since when do you take after-dinner walks?,LEONARD,HOWARD
891,"Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.",LEONARD,SHELDON
892,That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.,SHELDON,LEONARD
893,"Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.",PENNY,LEONARD
894,All right.,RAJ,SHELDON
895,"So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.",PENNY,PENNY
896,"That’s okay, keep it. Where’s Christie.",PENNY,SHELDON
897,"Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?",SHELDON,PENNY
898,We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style.,OTHERS,SHELDON
899,What if it’s booby-trapped?,RAJ,PENNY
900,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
901,"Well, hey. Now she’s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters.",SHELDON,SHELDON
902,"Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
903,Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?,OTHERS,SHELDON
904,"Anyway, Sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter.",HOWARD,LEONARD
905,Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.,LEONARD,SHELDON
906,"Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.",SHELDON,SHELDON
907,"That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again.",OTHERS,LEONARD
908,"Brown rice, not white?",SHELDON,PENNY
909,"Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.",SHELDON,SHELDON
910,"Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman.",HOWARD,HOWARD
911,It was?,OTHERS,SHELDON
912,"Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
913,"Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.",RAJ,SHELDON
914,What you writing there?,PENNY,PENNY
915,"Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki.",SHELDON,LEONARD
916,Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.,SHELDON,SHELDON
917,"Seriously, none of you liked it?",PENNY,SHELDON
918,I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.,PENNY,LEONARD
919,You weren’t the ball.,SHELDON,LEONARD
920,You’re too late.,SHELDON,SHELDON
921,Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.,SHELDON,SHELDON
922,"Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t live here.",OTHERS,PENNY
923,Oh! You’re kidding.,PENNY,SHELDON
924,"Fine, then you go.",LEONARD,RAJ
925,"Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back.",PENNY,PENNY
926,Penny? You okay?,LEONARD,SHELDON
927,"I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
928,That sounds really fun.,LEONARD,SHELDON
929,"Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby.",OTHERS,PENNY
930,"Hey, there.",HOWARD,PENNY
931,"Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?",SHELDON,OTHERS
932,"Yeah. You tell him, babe.",PENNY,SHELDON
933,Right.,OTHERS,PENNY
934,"Bye, Penny. I’m sorry, dude, she didn’t look anything like her picture.",OTHERS,SHELDON
935,"Yeah, how about that? See you soon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
936,"The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.",SHELDON,LEONARD
937,"Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.",RAJ,PENNY
938,an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.,RAJ,SHELDON
939,I don’t see anything.,HOWARD,SHELDON
940,Nothing. I was acting.,SHELDON,RAJ
941,That’s it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
942,"Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.",OTHERS,SHELDON
943,"It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.",LEONARD,PENNY
944,"Thank you, that’s very helpful.",SHELDON,OTHERS
945,You know you’re going to wind up walking it.,OTHERS,HOWARD
946,"Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve.",SHELDON,SHELDON
947,And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.,RAJ,SHELDON
948,Sheldon?,PENNY,SHELDON
949,"I, I don’t know if you remember me.",RAJ,SHELDON
950,"Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?",SHELDON,LEONARD
951,"Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you.",HOWARD,HOWARD
952,Fair enough. I’ll leave you in peace.,HOWARD,HOWARD
953,"Okay, continuing our quest.",LEONARD,SHELDON
954,"Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.",HOWARD,HOWARD
955,See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.,OTHERS,OTHERS
956,"You may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great.",OTHERS,LEONARD
957,Then don’t do it.,RAJ,SHELDON
958,Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?,LEONARD,SHELDON
959,"That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.",LEONARD,PENNY
960,"We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?",RAJ,PENNY
961,Is she okay?,PENNY,LEONARD
962,"You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!",SHELDON,SHELDON
963,"Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.",HOWARD,SHELDON
964,Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.,PENNY,LEONARD
965,"First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick.",HOWARD,SHELDON
966,NEVER!,LEONARD,HOWARD
967,"Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
968,What?,RAJ,PENNY
969,Really? So you can control it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
970,"Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…",PENNY,SHELDON
971,And it only took 28 minutes.,RAJ,SHELDON
972,"No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.",RAJ,OTHERS
973,Can we talk about this later.,SHELDON,SHELDON
974,"Howard, stop it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
975,"Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.",PENNY,RAJ
976,No.,PENNY,SHELDON
977,And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
978,Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.,OTHERS,PENNY
979,"Oh, my God, I’m crying already.",RAJ,HOWARD
980,Hi.,OTHERS,HOWARD
981,"I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.",HOWARD,PENNY
982,Worst bedtime story ever.,PENNY,SHELDON
983,Where would you go?,RAJ,LEONARD
984,"Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying.",SHELDON,LEONARD
985,She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?,PENNY,PENNY
986,"Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil.",PENNY,RAJ
987,It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?,RAJ,SHELDON
988,We’re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.,OTHERS,LEONARD
989,Funny. You boys have a nice time?,OTHERS,SHELDON
990,"No, absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
991,She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.,SHELDON,LEONARD
992,Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?,RAJ,LEONARD
993,"What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.",HOWARD,LEONARD
994,"No you didn’t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.",PENNY,RAJ
995,And what?,OTHERS,SHELDON
996,"Oh, that was never happening.",SHELDON,SHELDON
997,"Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.",OTHERS,SHELDON
998,"Okay, this place does look pretty good.",PENNY,PENNY
999,"Why, you guys going somewhere?",PENNY,SHELDON
1000,"Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1001,"Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it’s Lee, but I prefer Trouble.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1002,"Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.",RAJ,PENNY
1003,Are you crying?,RAJ,LEONARD
1004,"No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1005,Oh. All right.,RAJ,LEONARD
1006,"Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.",PENNY,RAJ
1007,"Hey, buddy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1008,You can’t make me feel bad.,RAJ,LEONARD
1009,When was the last time you saw her?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1010,Okay.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1011,I told you to use the walkie-talkie!,SHELDON,PENNY
1012,Hang on.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1013,"Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1014,You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1015,"Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1016,"No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1017,"If you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when I told you?",PENNY,RAJ
1018,"No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1019,Why are you dressed like that?,OTHERS,OTHERS
1020,Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1021,"Message received. Ah, excuse me.  Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That’s weird. I’m getting called in to Human Resources.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1022,"Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1023,"Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1024,Focused Locust.,RAJ,LEONARD
1025,"If he were, I wouldn’t be.",LEONARD,OTHERS
1026,I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1027,"Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1028,Exactly. See how well we work together?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1029,"Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists.",PENNY,LEONARD
1030,"Oh, nice to meet you.",PENNY,PENNY
1031,"Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet.",PENNY,SHELDON
1032,"Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1033,It’s right there.,PENNY,PENNY
1034,"Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.",PENNY,SHELDON
1035,"Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!",SHELDON,LEONARD
1036,Maybe they just want to be friends.,LEONARD,PENNY
1037,"Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you.",PENNY,SHELDON
1038,"Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.",PENNY,LEONARD
1039,"But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1040,"Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1041,Amy.  Amy.  Angry Amy.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1042,"Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…",LEONARD,LEONARD
1043,Let’s just play.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1044,"Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1045,"Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don’t answer. I’d love to.",RAJ,SHELDON
1046,He made you his screensaver.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1047,"Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children.",HOWARD,RAJ
1048,"Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.",LEONARD,PENNY
1049,That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.,OTHERS,PENNY
1050,"Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1051,"Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.",RAJ,RAJ
1052,As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1053,So you guys are seriously considering this?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1054,"Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1055,"Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1056,Let’s try open.,PENNY,SHELDON
1057,"Oh, good. What are they?",OTHERS,SHELDON
1058,"Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.",RAJ,SHELDON
1059,What did you do?,RAJ,SHELDON
1060,And a large number of people will believe it never happened.,RAJ,OTHERS
1061,"Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1062,Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1063,Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.,RAJ,SHELDON
1064,I don’t care. Get the Tardis.,HOWARD,LEONARD

1066,"Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1067,I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.,OTHERS,PENNY

1095,What?,LEONARD,PENNY
1096,Thank you.,OTHERS,PENNY
1097,"I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child.",OTHERS,PENNY
1098,"Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?",OTHERS,LEONARD
1099,"Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.",RAJ,SHELDON

1101,Hey. Good to see you.,RAJ,OTHERS
1102,"Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.",PENNY,LEONARD
1103,"I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1104,You’re going to leave me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1105,You’re just saying that to make me feel better.,SHELDON,OTHERS

1107,"I, I’m fine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1108,"Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?",OTHERS,SHELDON

1112,So what? It’s the same food.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1113,Thank you.,PENNY,PENNY

1120,"Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1121,Hello.,RAJ,PENNY

1144,Once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.,HOWARD,PENNY
1145,Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.,HOWARD,PENNY
1146,You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1147,"Yeah, let’s go with that.",HOWARD,RAJ
1148,Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.,HOWARD,SHELDON

1150,What’s the idea?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1151,"No, thank you.",OTHERS,OTHERS
1152,"Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place.",PENNY,LEONARD
1153,"Well, you don’t owe me an explanation.",PENNY,LEONARD
1154,Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1155,"Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home.  I’m not getting the computing time, am I?",SHELDON,LEONARD
1156,And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.,SHELDON,LEONARD

1160,It is pretty spicy.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1161,"It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.",LEONARD,PENNY
1162,"Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.",LEONARD,OTHERS
1163,"No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.",OTHERS,PENNY
1164,"Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1165,You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1166,"Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.",PENNY,LEONARD
1167,"It is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?",LEONARD,LEONARD

1180,I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.,PENNY,LEONARD

1183,I meant a Hindu temple.,RAJ,RAJ
1184,Hello?,RAJ,LEONARD
1185,You mean my cello?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1186,"Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it.",HOWARD,RAJ

1201,"No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project.",OTHERS,LEONARD

1203,So we can communicate through the wall.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1204,"Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1205,I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.,OTHERS,LEONARD

1211,You mean a forklift?,HOWARD,RAJ
1212,"Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.",PENNY,PENNY
1213,"All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.",PENNY,OTHERS
1214,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
1215,"No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.",OTHERS,RAJ
1216,I guess.,LEONARD,PENNY
1217,I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.,OTHERS,OTHERS
1218,"Not so far, but that’s not the point!",HOWARD,SHELDON
1219,"Not me, paternity leave.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1220,I don’t understand.,OTHERS,HOWARD
1221,My burps taste like cranberry juice.,OTHERS,HOWARD
1222,"Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1223,"Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.",OTHERS,HOWARD
1224,"W-W-Wait, what’s going on?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1225,"Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?",PENNY,PENNY
1226,"Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.",RAJ,SHELDON

1233,Thank you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1234,Why is he looking at it?,HOWARD,SHELDON
1235,Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1236,"No, I don’t.",SHELDON,PENNY
1237,I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1238,We’re not living together.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1239,"Huh, what does that make us?",RAJ,HOWARD
1240,"Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks.",PENNY,SHELDON
1241,Good for you. Sign here.,SHELDON,PENNY
1242,Okay.,LEONARD,LEONARD

1244,"I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.",RAJ,RAJ
1245,This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1246,"Wait, I got it. I got it/",LEONARD,RAJ
1247,"Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?",HOWARD,HOWARD
1248,Can you please just let it go?,OTHERS,RAJ
1249,I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.,OTHERS,PENNY

1253,"Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading.",SHELDON,RAJ
1254,"Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1255,I got a colossal serpent right here.,RAJ,LEONARD

1257,"Aw, that was beautiful.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1258,"Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1259,Sure.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1260,"Yeah, of course.",RAJ,LEONARD

1266,I’m trying to shoot.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1267,You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1268,"I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..",SHELDON,LEONARD
1269,"Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1270,There’s a cucumber in my water.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1271,Walls are getting closer.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1272,"Well, now don’t you feel silly.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1273,"Yeah, I know what you mean.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1274,"Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1275,"Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1276,Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?,HOWARD,SHELDON
1277,"Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.",OTHERS,PENNY

1282,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1283,When I have to.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1284,I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1285,"Okay, we used to go out, right?",LEONARD,SHELDON

1293,We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.,RAJ,SHELDON
1294,Why would you say that?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1295,"Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1296,"Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?",OTHERS,PENNY
1297,Copy that. Over.,SHELDON,PENNY
1298,"Hey, that’s amazing.",OTHERS,HOWARD

1301,Do you think I have a shot with Penny?,RAJ,LEONARD
1302,"Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?",LEONARD,PENNY
1303,"Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1304,India.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1305,"There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.",RAJ,LEONARD
1306,"Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…",LEONARD,PENNY
1307,"Sure, that’s another way to go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1308,Were you like this when I married you?,HOWARD,SHELDON
1309,"Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1310,How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1311,"Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?",PENNY,SHELDON
1312,At least he’s off the train crap.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1313,Are you saying he’s man-struating?,HOWARD,SHELDON
1314,I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?,HOWARD,PENNY
1315,"Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1316,Why?,OTHERS,SHELDON
1317,"Penny, you know those are real, right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1318,"But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1319,A lackey?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1320,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
1321,"Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.",RAJ,SHELDON
1322,Would they really do that?,PENNY,SHELDON
1323,"Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.",OTHERS,PENNY
1324,"If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don’t want that either.",SHELDON,PENNY
1325,"Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1326,"I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved.",LEONARD,PENNY
1327,"We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?",RAJ,HOWARD
1328,We’re back.,PENNY,LEONARD
1329,"If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.",SHELDON,LEONARD

1331,"Knock, knock.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1332,"What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1333,"Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.",PENNY,SHELDON
1334,"Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1335,I would do that.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1336,You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.,RAJ,PENNY
1337,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1338,Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.,HOWARD,PENNY
1339,One more time?,HOWARD,LEONARD

1342,"Sheldon, are you okay?",PENNY,HOWARD
1343,You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.,OTHERS,HOWARD
1344,"Bernie, you okay?",HOWARD,SHELDON
1345,I helped run some cable for a webcam.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1346,You don’t wanna wash that.,PENNY,LEONARD
1347,Uh-uh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1348,"Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1349,Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1350,It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.,SHELDON,PENNY
1351,I think there’s something going on between the two of them.,PENNY,LEONARD
1352,And a complete sucker.,SHELDON,RAJ
1353,"Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1354,I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.,SHELDON,PENNY
1355,"You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1356,"Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.",PENNY,SHELDON

1358,Okay.,PENNY,SHELDON
1359,"You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now.",HOWARD,PENNY

1362,What is it about trains that you like so much?,OTHERS,SHELDON
1363,Where are you going?,SHELDON,PENNY
1364,Let’s do it.,HOWARD,PENNY
1365,"Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.",LEONARD,PENNY
1366,"Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.",RAJ,OTHERS
1367,Why?,RAJ,PENNY
1368,"What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?",HOWARD,PENNY
1369,What? This road trip just got crazy.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1370,"Good night, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON
1371,"Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1372,So you could teach me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
1373,"Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.",RAJ,LEONARD

1379,"Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1380,"I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck.",OTHERS,PENNY

1383,"Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.",RAJ,HOWARD
1384,"Coming. Hey, lovebug.",LEONARD,OTHERS
1385,It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?,SHELDON,PENNY
1386,"Yeah, but I’m a make out king.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1387,"Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1388,Yes?,OTHERS,PENNY
1389,I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1390,"You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?",LEONARD,RAJ
1391,"Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.",RAJ,LEONARD
1392,I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.,LEONARD,OTHERS
1393,Dr. Fowler?,SHELDON,HOWARD

1395,"Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1396,If you didn’t press record…,SHELDON,HOWARD
1397,"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1398,I could do that.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1399,Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.,HOWARD,SHELDON

1401,Thank you for your time.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1402,"Hold on, I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No, I’m happy I don’t have to go.",PENNY,SHELDON
1403,Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?,LEONARD,PENNY
1404,"Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1405,"Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",SHELDON,HOWARD

1407,"Hey, guys.",PENNY,PENNY
1408,"Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.",PENNY,RAJ
1409,"Good to see you, Mother.",LEONARD,PENNY
1410,That’s still not funny.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1411,"Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.",RAJ,SHELDON
1412,But you finished your experiment a week ago.,RAJ,SHELDON
1413,I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1414,"No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1415,Really?,LEONARD,HOWARD
1416,An acting choice.,PENNY,RAJ
1417,"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1418,Really?,PENNY,SHELDON

1422,Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?,RAJ,OTHERS
1423,"So, did you wind up sending that machine back?",PENNY,LEONARD
1424,Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?,OTHERS,HOWARD
1425,"Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1426,And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.,RAJ,PENNY
1427,This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.,SHELDON,PENNY
1428,How long should we stay?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1429,It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.,SHELDON,RAJ
1430,Is that a pregnancy thing?,PENNY,SHELDON
1431,And don’t start thinking about it now.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1432,"I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.",SHELDON,PENNY
1433,Hold on. He could come back.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1434,Yeah. Anywhere you want.,HOWARD,PENNY
1435,"Well, what can we do to cheer you up?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1436,Come again?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1437,Very hard.,LEONARD,RAJ
1438,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1439,"Oh, I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…",SHELDON,RAJ
1440,Hello.,RAJ,PENNY
1441,Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1442,"Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.",LEONARD,PENNY
1443,"Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1444,"Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?",PENNY,LEONARD
1445,Hi.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1446,Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?,RAJ,PENNY
1447,Why not?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1448,"Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1449,You can’t cook and you made me this.,SHELDON,PENNY
1450,"Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?",HOWARD,PENNY
1451,"There’s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn’t that right Leonard.",PENNY,LEONARD
1452,You bumped the table and you know it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1453,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.",LEONARD,OTHERS
1454,E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1455,"Well, where would you go?",PENNY,PENNY
1456,"I guess you talked to your mom, huh?",OTHERS,SHELDON
1457,Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!,LEONARD,OTHERS
1458,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1459,"Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.",LEONARD,PENNY
1460,Uuuuuuuh!,OTHERS,HOWARD
1461,I know. I read it before I threw it out.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1462,Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1463,"Yeah, I think it will be.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1464,"Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.",HOWARD,RAJ
1465,Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!,HOWARD,HOWARD
1466,Oh. Right.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1467,"Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.",PENNY,LEONARD
1468,"Goodbye, peasants.",SHELDON,RAJ
1469,"Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1470,"Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1471,Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!,LEONARD,LEONARD
1472,I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1473,"Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!",PENNY,LEONARD
1474,Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1475,What’s up?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1476,We’re home.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1477,"Sheldon, how could you do this? It’s our second anniversary.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1478,"Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.",SHELDON,PENNY
1479,"No, but I can name all the Kardashians.",PENNY,LEONARD
1480,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.,SHELDON,PENNY
1481,Damn those sons of bitches!,HOWARD,SHELDON
1482,"I’m at work, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1483,"He does sound effects, too!",SHELDON,LEONARD
1484,Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1485,"Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny.",RAJ,LEONARD
1486,I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1487,But we have to set some boundaries.,HOWARD,PENNY
1488,Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1489,East Texas.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1490,"I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1491,What are you doing?,RAJ,SHELDON
1492,It’s stupid.,PENNY,PENNY
1493,"Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.",LEONARD,RAJ
1494,"So, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.",PENNY,SHELDON
1495,I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.,PENNY,SHELDON
1496,"Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.",RAJ,SHELDON
1497,What’s that?,RAJ,SHELDON
1498,What’s the matter?,RAJ,SHELDON
1499,"Yes, but what does it stand for?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1500,"No, it’s this Friday, at eight.",LEONARD,PENNY
1501,How did we get in the car?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1502,"Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”",LEONARD,OTHERS
1503,"What does that mean, active social life?",OTHERS,SHELDON
1504,Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1505,"Oh, uh, yeah. I got ’em on Amazon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1506,The problem appears to be unsolvable.,SHELDON,OTHERS
1507,Sure.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1508,"Yeah, he’s gonna win the Nobel prize.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1509,Fine. Whisper it.,OTHERS,RAJ
1510,"Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1511,"You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1512,"Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1513,"Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business.",RAJ,LEONARD
1514,"Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?",PENNY,LEONARD
1515,"Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1516,How many of these can you make a day?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1517,You’re done. He’s done.,OTHERS,HOWARD
1518,Isn’t it a little early for that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1519,I’d like to refer that to my attorney.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1520,"This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1521,"Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1522,"No, of course not. I just, I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings.",PENNY,SHELDON
1523,"You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?",SHELDON,LEONARD
1524,"Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.",PENNY,SHELDON
1525,"Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1526,Piercing my ears.,OTHERS,PENNY
1527,Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.,PENNY,PENNY
1528,What if they call our names?,PENNY,SHELDON
1529,"He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.",PENNY,PENNY
1530,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY
1531,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?,PENNY,SHELDON
1532,That’s Sheldon.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1533,"No, it’s not the… Never mind.",SHELDON,PENNY
1534,Potato clock. Do potato clock.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1535,Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1536,"I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1537,"In a bad way, very bad.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1538,What did it say?,PENNY,SHELDON
1539,This is not a good time.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1540,Bye.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1541,But we haven’t finished the puzzle.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1542,Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.,LEONARD,PENNY
1543,"She’s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn’t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1544,That would be me.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1545,How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?,PENNY,LEONARD
1546,"Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.",SHELDON,PENNY
1547,"Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.",RAJ,HOWARD
1548,"Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1549,"Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no.",SHELDON,PENNY
1550,Formal protest.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1551,Oh.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1552,Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.,HOWARD,HOWARD
1553,"Oh, that’s not a good name.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1554,"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1555,"Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.",SHELDON,OTHERS
1556,"Hunger? Indigestion, I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1557,"Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1558,Why can’t it be a woman cave?,OTHERS,SHELDON
1559,"Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1560,Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.,SHELDON,OTHERS
1561,"Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.",RAJ,SHELDON
1562,Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1563,Wish me luck.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1564,"Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1565,"Penny, don’t.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1566,"Thanks for dinner, buddy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1567,And?,PENNY,SHELDON
1568,Are you even listening to me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1569,Is that it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1570,"My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude.",SHELDON,RAJ
1571,"Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1572,"Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!",SHELDON,SHELDON
1573,"Well, I got you a little going away present.",PENNY,OTHERS
1574,"On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?",SHELDON,RAJ
1575,"To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1576,I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.,HOWARD,SHELDON
1577,"Sheldon, this place is so romantic.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1578,You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.,SHELDON,PENNY
1579,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.,SHELDON,PENNY
1580,"Hey, guys.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1581,"Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1582,"Oh, actually, we’re an hour late.",OTHERS,PENNY
1583,"Well, don’t be too mean.",RAJ,OTHERS
1584,"Hey, pretty lady.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1585,Way better.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1586,"I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.",PENNY,OTHERS
1587,What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?,HOWARD,RAJ
1588,"All right, but I have some conditions.",RAJ,SHELDON
1589,"Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?",OTHERS,RAJ
1590,"Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1591,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.,RAJ,PENNY
1592,NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?,LEONARD,OTHERS
1593,"You started it, dude.",RAJ,LEONARD
1594,How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1595,No.,RAJ,SHELDON
1596,"I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.",SHELDON,PENNY
1597,"And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1598,"Oh, you could turn his act into extract, and it would be for double points.",OTHERS,PENNY
1599,I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1600,"What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.",PENNY,PENNY
1601,"No, this is creepy.",RAJ,LEONARD
1602,Maybe we should take a step back.,LEONARD,OTHERS
1603,Wow. Your life’s amazing.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1604,I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.,LEONARD,PENNY
1605,"In fact, that’s when I started to really miss you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1606,You actually smell the wine?,PENNY,LEONARD
1607,"You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1608,I feel like we’re forgetting something important.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1609,And I told you I get diaper rash.,RAJ,LEONARD
1610,"Merry Christmas, Sheldon.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1611,Exactly.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1612,It was tapenade and you guys suck.,RAJ,LEONARD
1613,"Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1614,Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.,HOWARD,PENNY
1615,I never doubted you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1616,"Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had.",PENNY,SHELDON
1617,"And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1618,"So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1619,"Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.",PENNY,SHELDON
1620,"Yeah, me neither.",RAJ,SHELDON
1621,"No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1622,"I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…",RAJ,PENNY
1623,Toilet.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1624,See? Howard’s on my side.,SHELDON,PENNY
1625,Yes?,LEONARD,SHELDON
1626,"Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1627,"Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1628,"Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?",RAJ,PENNY
1629,"We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.",RAJ,SHELDON
1630,"If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1631,"Oh, what did those rascals do now?",PENNY,LEONARD
1632,"Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?",LEONARD,HOWARD
1633,"So here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you’d say yes?",HOWARD,SHELDON
1634,I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1635,"Yeah, definitely better before.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1636,"Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.",PENNY,SHELDON
1637,I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.,LEONARD,OTHERS
1638,"No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1639,"Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.",PENNY,HOWARD
1640,I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.,SHELDON,PENNY

1642,"Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.",OTHERS,PENNY
1643,I think I can see my breath.,OTHERS,RAJ
1644,Hey.,PENNY,HOWARD

1647,"No, thank you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1648,Both.,PENNY,LEONARD
1649,"Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.",HOWARD,SHELDON
1650,You really need to work on your penmanship.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1651,He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?,OTHERS,RAJ
1652,"Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1653,They bought it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
1654,"Oh, God, did he make a move on you?",PENNY,RAJ
1655,"Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1656,Let’s go.,PENNY,PENNY
1657,"Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel.",LEONARD,RAJ
1658,Where were you so late?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1659,I’m not surprised.,SHELDON,PENNY
1660,Terrific. Thank you.  They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.,OTHERS,OTHERS

1665,I’m just saying…,HOWARD,SHELDON
1666,"Okay, first of all…",HOWARD,SHELDON
1667,"I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.",PENNY,SHELDON
1668,Are you ill?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1669,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1670,"I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.",RAJ,OTHERS
1671,"Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you’re dessert.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1672,How?,OTHERS,LEONARD
1673,"Uh, fifteen or higher.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1674,You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?,SHELDON,HOWARD

1684,Got it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1685,Ugh!,LEONARD,SHELDON
1686,"Well, you defended me, right?",PENNY,HOWARD
1687,"Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200",OTHERS,PENNY
1688,So messed up.,SHELDON,PENNY
1689,Water nymph.,LEONARD,HOWARD
1690,"Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.",OTHERS,RAJ
1691,"जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?",RAJ,LEONARD

1693,"Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1694,"Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?",OTHERS,SHELDON
1695,"Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.",OTHERS,PENNY
1696,And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.,RAJ,LEONARD
1697,"Hmm, what do you think?",SHELDON,PENNY
1698,"I know, I know.",HOWARD,LEONARD
1699,And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.,PENNY,LEONARD
1700,Is it too much?,LEONARD,RAJ
1701,Smart. We don’t want any problems.,SHELDON,SHELDON
1702,"Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!",PENNY,SHELDON
1703,"No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.",LEONARD,PENNY
1704,Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1705,There you go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
1706,Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the,HOWARD,PENNY

1710,Can I at least kick down the door?,SHELDON,LEONARD

1726,"Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.",PENNY,SHELDON
1727,"Me, too.",OTHERS,RAJ
1728,"Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1729,"So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1730,The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1731,Three dates means sex? Who knew?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1732,Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.,PENNY,OTHERS
1733,Shh!,HOWARD,SHELDON
1734,But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1735,"I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.",OTHERS,LEONARD
1736,"Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1737,"Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1738,Then guess.,HOWARD,LEONARD
1739,Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.,LEONARD,SHELDON
1740,Wrong. Leonard?,SHELDON,LEONARD
1741,"Look, do you want to buy me out or not?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1742,Then what happens?,LEONARD,SHELDON

1749,"Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.",LEONARD,LEONARD

1752,Leonard.,SHELDON,HOWARD
1753,"Well, this sucks.",LEONARD,RAJ
1754,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
1755,Crazy bastard?,SHELDON,HOWARD
1756,Of course.,RAJ,SHELDON
1757,"Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?",LEONARD,SHELDON
1758,"Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1759,Why?,HOWARD,LEONARD
1760,"So, where do you guys want to go dancing?",PENNY,PENNY
1761,"The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent.",PENNY,SHELDON
1762,It’s one of his best moves.,RAJ,HOWARD
1763,Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?,LEONARD,LEONARD
1764,"Penny! If I’m going to buy Leonard a gift, I’m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1765,I assume we’re talking about you now?,SHELDON,SHELDON
1766,"Um, I don’t know, maybe.",LEONARD,LEONARD
1767,"And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.",SHELDON,RAJ
1768,"No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?",SHELDON,SHELDON
1769,"Yes, you did, didn’t you?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1770,"Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I’d wear cargo pants.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1771,"The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t.",LEONARD,SHELDON
1772,"Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1773,Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.,LEONARD,LEONARD

1776,"Well, you’re acting all weird, and I’m pretty weird, so I think I know what I’m talking about.",OTHERS,SHELDON
1777,"Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1778,"Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1779,"Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1780,You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.,SHELDON,LEONARD
1781,"Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…",OTHERS,SHELDON
1782,"I know. The only thing is, I’m gonna be gone for two years.",HOWARD,HOWARD
1783,Of course I do.,OTHERS,PENNY
1784,Uh…,LEONARD,PENNY
1785,I don’t know.,RAJ,SHELDON
1786,"I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.",SHELDON,OTHERS
1787,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….",PENNY,LEONARD
1788,"Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.",SHELDON,HOWARD
1789,"No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.",OTHERS,SHELDON

1793,"Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?",LEONARD,LEONARD
1794,"Hey, where are you?",PENNY,LEONARD
1795,You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.,RAJ,LEONARD
1796,"All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.",SHELDON,SHELDON
1797,"Oh, my, I would love that.",PENNY,LEONARD
1798,"Well, that is an important part.",OTHERS,RAJ
1799,Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.,OTHERS,LEONARD

1801,"Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?",PENNY,LEONARD
1802,"I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.",SHELDON,PENNY
1803,"Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.",RAJ,HOWARD
1804,"Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!",RAJ,SHELDON

1809,"I don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him?",LEONARD,SHELDON

1828,"It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.",LEONARD,LEONARD

1830,"Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I’ll take it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1831,Can I give you a ride to the airport?,OTHERS,SHELDON

1877,"I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in. Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.",SHELDON,LEONARD
1878,"Of course, why?",OTHERS,PENNY

2006,"Well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out.",RAJ,SHELDON
2007,Sorry.,LEONARD,HOWARD

2010,And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2011,Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.,SHELDON,SHELDON

2013,"Subtle, mom, real subtle.",LEONARD,SHELDON

2016,Good evening.,OTHERS,PENNY
2017,I don’t drink coffee.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2018,"I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.",LEONARD,PENNY
2019,"Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.",PENNY,SHELDON
2020,"Oh, we’re smarter than that.",OTHERS,PENNY
2021,"Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.",SHELDON,RAJ
2022,"Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.",OTHERS,PENNY
2023,"Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?",PENNY,LEONARD
2024,I highly doubt that. Go away.. Are you still out there?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2025,Coming up.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2026,"What do you mean, yes?",OTHERS,LEONARD
2027,"Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2028,"Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.",PENNY,SHELDON
2029,"Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.",RAJ,RAJ
2030,Not really.,LEONARD,PENNY
2031,Metrosexual my ass.,OTHERS,PENNY
2032,Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.,SHELDON,RAJ
2033,Why don’t you just call tech support?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2034,I can’t do it with you staring at me.,PENNY,SHELDON
2035,"Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2036,Mimesis?,LEONARD,PENNY
2037,"Well, what about me?",PENNY,PENNY
2038,Good for you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2039,"Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.",RAJ,LEONARD
2040,"Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2041,Action.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2042,"I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2043,You went with Thor?,LEONARD,RAJ

2045,Sheldon.,OTHERS,PENNY
2046,"All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2047,"Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2048,I informed you thusly.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2049,"You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.",PENNY,SHELDON
2050,"Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it.",PENNY,LEONARD
2051,"Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…",SHELDON,LEONARD
2052,Oh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2053,Hey.,OTHERS,LEONARD

2056,"After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2057,"I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2058,"So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?",OTHERS,LEONARD
2059,"Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2060,Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2061,"I’ll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2062,"When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.",SHELDON,PENNY
2063,"You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.",HOWARD,PENNY
2064,What?,LEONARD,PENNY
2065,Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2066,It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2067,Maybe something less personal.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2068,"I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?",PENNY,HOWARD
2069,"Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.",LEONARD,RAJ
2070,Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.,RAJ,SHELDON
2071,Like this one?,HOWARD,PENNY
2072,There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2073,"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.",PENNY,PENNY
2074,Hi.,RAJ,SHELDON

2076,"Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.",PENNY,LEONARD
2077,It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2078,"Um, good night, Stuart.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2079,"He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2080,You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?,PENNY,LEONARD
2081,Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?,PENNY,SHELDON
2082,You violated the sanctity of my mouth.,SHELDON,PENNY
2083,Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2084,I’m gonna kill her.,PENNY,SHELDON
2085,Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2086,"Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.",LEONARD,RAJ
2087,"Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2088,I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2089,"Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and I forgot it there.",PENNY,SHELDON
2090,"Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2091,It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2092,"Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee.",HOWARD,HOWARD
2093,Sorry about that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2094,"If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2095,"Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.",LEONARD,PENNY
2096,But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.,PENNY,PENNY
2097,"Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?",HOWARD,SHELDON
2098,I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2099,"Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice.",PENNY,PENNY
2100,"To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty.",LEONARD,SHELDON

2103,"Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2104,"I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.",SHELDON,PENNY
2105,And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.,RAJ,LEONARD
2106,"All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2107,Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2108,"Okay, I guess we’re improvising now.",PENNY,SHELDON
2109,The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.,OTHERS,PENNY
2110,"Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.",PENNY,LEONARD
2111,"Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2112,Negative reinforcement is really wrong?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2113,"Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.",SHELDON,PENNY
2114,No!,PENNY,LEONARD
2115,"Hey, that’s my shirt.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2116,"I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2117,"In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2118,"Let’s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?",SHELDON,OTHERS
2119,We don’t want you to know.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2120,"Yeah, what happened?",OTHERS,OTHERS
2121,Yeah?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2122,"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.",SHELDON,RAJ
2123,It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2124,"So, uh, what are you guys talking about?",RAJ,SHELDON
2125,Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.,OTHERS,PENNY
2126,What happened?,SHELDON,RAJ
2127,We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.,RAJ,PENNY
2128,Back off Sheldon.,RAJ,RAJ
2129,That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2130,"Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2131,"Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2132,Are you kidding me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2133,Shh! Here comes my joke.,PENNY,LEONARD
2134,You’re making me worry. What’s going on?,OTHERS,HOWARD
2135,"Yeah, wow.",HOWARD,PENNY
2136,"He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.",PENNY,SHELDON
2137,I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.,OTHERS,PENNY
2138,How is that not good?,PENNY,SHELDON
2139,Call me when you figure it out.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2140,"You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2141,I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2142,Why are you back from your date so early?,PENNY,HOWARD
2143,"Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2144,You said it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2145,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2146,"Hi, sweetie.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2147,"That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.",HOWARD,PENNY
2148,When did this happen?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2149,"Well, sickly is the new sexy.",PENNY,LEONARD
2150,"No, I can’t authorize that.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2151,I would like to propose a salon topic.,RAJ,LEONARD
2152,"So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?",OTHERS,PENNY
2153,Really? That’s very unsettling.,SHELDON,PENNY
2154,Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2155,Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2156,"Oh, that sounds romantic.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2157,Which you also figured out by yourself.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2158,Are we done with this?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2159,That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2160,I’m brown and I talk funny.,RAJ,LEONARD
2161,"It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.",PENNY,RAJ
2162,And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.,RAJ,LEONARD
2163,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2164,I’m sorry. Proceed.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2165,"Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here.",LEONARD,PENNY
2166,Rajesh?,OTHERS,PENNY
2167,Like what?,PENNY,HOWARD
2168,You can’t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2169,It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.,PENNY,SHELDON
2170,What’s that?,PENNY,RAJ
2171,I worked on it all night. Use it.,RAJ,HOWARD
2172,See you guys at work.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2173,"You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2174,"Well, there was a lot of action.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2175,You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2176,Thank you.,RAJ,LEONARD
2177,"Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2178,Good.,SHELDON,PENNY
2179,"I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2180,"Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2181,"I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2182,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY
2183,I think this is the place.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2184,"Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2185,"I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2186,"Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.",PENNY,PENNY
2187,Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?,RAJ,SHELDON
2188,I work at the church.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2189,A little baby.,RAJ,OTHERS

2191,"Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.",OTHERS,RAJ
2192,"289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.",SHELDON,RAJ
2193,"Oh, I love that movie.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2194,"Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.",HOWARD,RAJ
2195,The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?,OTHERS,HOWARD
2196,We could go to a bar.,PENNY,LEONARD
2197,No problem.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2198,Yes.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2199,"Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2200,"The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in, like, ever.",PENNY,LEONARD
2201,"Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2202,What happened?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2203,And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2204,I call everyone sweetie.,PENNY,SHELDON
2205,"Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2206,"It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?",HOWARD,HOWARD
2207,"Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.",RAJ,SHELDON

2213,Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2214,"That bad, huh?",PENNY,SHELDON
2215,I played that pretty well.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2216,"You know what, I’m not gonna go either. I’m a father now. I’d rather spend time with my family.",HOWARD,RAJ
2217,"But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2218,"Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2219,"Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it’s junior rodeo on.",PENNY,OTHERS
2220,Oh!,HOWARD,SHELDON
2221,"This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2222,Get Stuart or Raj to do it.,HOWARD,LEONARD

2240,What’s up?,PENNY,PENNY
2241,"You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2242,"Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.",SHELDON,PENNY
2243,"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2244,"Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2245,You sure?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2246,Walking away.,SHELDON,PENNY

2251,Go.,PENNY,LEONARD
2252,"Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2253,"Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2254,They’re comfortable.,PENNY,SHELDON

2257,"Come on, snipers.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2258,"Yeah, it’s fine.",PENNY,SHELDON

2261,"Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.",PENNY,SHELDON

2266,Yeah. So?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2267,"Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option.",HOWARD,SHELDON

2270,"Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.",PENNY,LEONARD
2271,No.,OTHERS,PENNY

2273,"Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2274,"Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2275,"Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It’s a sweet green miracle.",RAJ,LEONARD
2276,And?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2277,"That’s enough, Sheldon.",LEONARD,PENNY
2278,Did he help you make a decision about the movie?,RAJ,PENNY
2279,"You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with…",LEONARD,PENNY
2280,"Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2281,"Long, long night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2282,"I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one.",LEONARD,PENNY
2283,"Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.",RAJ,RAJ
2284,"Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.",SHELDON,RAJ
2285,"Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire’s prostate sonogram?",OTHERS,LEONARD
2286,"Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2287,"So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.",PENNY,LEONARD
2288,"All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2289,"Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.",PENNY,HOWARD
2290,Hold on. What’s in it for us?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2291,"Uh, peace out!",SHELDON,SHELDON
2292,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
2293,"If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.",OTHERS,RAJ

2295,What’s so great?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2296,"And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.",PENNY,RAJ
2297,Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.,SHELDON,PENNY
2298,I didn’t buy it. I made it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2299,"Mm, just down there.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2300,I’m serious. I’ll do it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2301,"I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.",RAJ,SHELDON
2302,Who are you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2303,I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.,OTHERS,RAJ
2304,"Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2305,"No, he did not.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2306,You know what? It’s probably fine.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2307,Leonard’s really one of a kind.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2308,Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2309,"As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I’m having dinner with Amy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2310,"Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2311,Terrific.,LEONARD,PENNY
2312,You’re also too sensitive. Women don’t want that either.,OTHERS,PENNY
2313,You need to take that?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2314,You said we were invited.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2315,"Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.",PENNY,SHELDON
2316,Oh!,PENNY,SHELDON
2317,Wait.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2318,Father.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2319,You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2320,You want to go again? Let’s go.,HOWARD,RAJ
2321,"Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.",HOWARD,PENNY
2322,"Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2323,"Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me.",RAJ,LEONARD
2324,"Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2325,I’m sorry?,PENNY,SHELDON
2326,I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.,OTHERS,PENNY
2327,"Look, I don’t know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it.",HOWARD,PENNY
2328,"No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2329,Great.,PENNY,SHELDON
2330,"Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2331,"Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?",LEONARD,RAJ
2332,Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.,SHELDON,PENNY
2333,"Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2334,"Okay, that’s enough. Write down loving son.",RAJ,HOWARD
2335,"Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2336,"Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.",HOWARD,SHELDON

2338,Are we even in a good school…? Ow!,HOWARD,SHELDON
2339,"Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs.",SHELDON,PENNY
2340,What?,LEONARD,HOWARD
2341,But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.,RAJ,OTHERS
2342,I have an override switch.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2343,"He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge.",RAJ,LEONARD
2344,Did your boyfriend make you type that?,PENNY,LEONARD
2345,"No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2346,"That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2347,Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.,RAJ,HOWARD

2363,"On the one hand, if I say yes…",LEONARD,SHELDON
2364,Is this part of your super-aging?,OTHERS,PENNY
2365,"I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2366,Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.,RAJ,LEONARD

2371,Thank you for coming back.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2372,I’m very congested.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2373,"You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.",SHELDON,PENNY
2374,Sold.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2375,"Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2376,Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2377,"Oh, you’re kidding. Let me see. Well, I’ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2378,"Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I’ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2379,You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2380,Where did he pop the question? What did you say?,RAJ,SHELDON
2381,You know how the PennySaver only has my name…,SHELDON,SHELDON
2382,You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.,RAJ,LEONARD
2383,I hadn’t thought about that.,SHELDON,PENNY
2384,Why do they say AA?,LEONARD,OTHERS
2385,"You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2386,Wow. Where are you going to go?,PENNY,HOWARD
2387,I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.,LEONARD,PENNY

2396,"Penny, what did you say?",OTHERS,LEONARD
2397,I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2398,Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.,LEONARD,PENNY

2400,"No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?",OTHERS,OTHERS
2401,I was hoping we could talk about the money again.,LEONARD,LEONARD

2403,"Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2404,Very well.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2405,"Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”",LEONARD,PENNY
2406,No?,SHELDON,HOWARD
2407,Let’s sit somewhere else.,SHELDON,OTHERS
2408,"Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.",SHELDON,HOWARD

2423,I skipped spin class for this.,RAJ,LEONARD
2424,"It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2425,"I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2426,How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.,SHELDON,RAJ
2427,They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2428,Then let go of the ring and go.,RAJ,SHELDON
2429,"All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2430,"Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.",RAJ,LEONARD
2431,What do you want me to do?,PENNY,PENNY
2432,Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2433,"Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.",RAJ,LEONARD
2434,"No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.",RAJ,SHELDON
2435,A little snack. You got any string cheese?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2436,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2437,I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2438,"Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.",LEONARD,RAJ
2439,"And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.",RAJ,SHELDON
2440,That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2441,"Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…",SHELDON,SHELDON
2442,Are you turning it the right way?,RAJ,SHELDON
2443,Yours.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2444,Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2445,Knock-knock.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2446,"Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2447,"Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.",OTHERS,PENNY
2448,Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?,OTHERS,PENNY
2449,That’s your opinion.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2450,"My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2451,"Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2452,Is it diet?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2453,"Where, where, where are we?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2454,"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.",RAJ,SHELDON
2455,Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2456,"And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.",PENNY,OTHERS
2457,"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2458,What are you thinking?,LEONARD,OTHERS
2459,"Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2460,Can you believe this nerd?,OTHERS,HOWARD
2461,You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.,RAJ,PENNY
2462,And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.,PENNY,HOWARD
2463,"I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2464,"It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.",SHELDON,LEONARD

2466,This is an easy one. You love this guy.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2467,"Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes.",PENNY,SHELDON
2468,"No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.",PENNY,LEONARD
2469,"Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here’s Uranus.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2470,Been there.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2471,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2472,"Hey, how’s your sister?",PENNY,SHELDON
2473,"So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2474,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2475,We’re not stopping.,SHELDON,OTHERS
2476,"Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.",RAJ,SHELDON
2477,"Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2478,And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.,OTHERS,RAJ

2481,"I don’t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2482,"Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.",OTHERS,PENNY
2483,"Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.",PENNY,SHELDON
2484,"Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.",HOWARD,PENNY
2485,And now you’re also an astronaut.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2486,"I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2487,Priya?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2488,"Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.",SHELDON,PENNY
2489,"So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2490,"Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2491,"Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2492,No one ever does. That’s why it happens.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2493,What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2494,"And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.",SHELDON,PENNY
2495,"Hey, we’re home. Any progress?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2496,"I’m really sorry, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON

2498,"Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2499,"Now, can we please change the subject?",HOWARD,LEONARD
2500,"Well, it’s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.",PENNY,SHELDON

2502,"You made God sad today, Mom.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2503,It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.,PENNY,LEONARD
2504,"Oh, well, that kind of stinks.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2505,"Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it’s bright out. Isn’t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.",PENNY,LEONARD

2512,Hey.,HOWARD,OTHERS
2513,Oh. Done and done.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2514,You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.,OTHERS,PENNY
2515,You do?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2516,I know. I feel so grown up.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2517,"Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2518,Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2519,"Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2520,"Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.",OTHERS,PENNY

2527,Will that calm my nerves?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2528,Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.,RAJ,RAJ
2529,"Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.",HOWARD,RAJ
2530,"It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?",OTHERS,PENNY
2531,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2532,It’s blackmail!,LEONARD,PENNY
2533,Thanks. Oh. Great party.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2534,"You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2535,"It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.",LEONARD,SHELDON

2541,"Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.",OTHERS,PENNY
2542,"Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story.",RAJ,OTHERS
2543,Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2544,All right. What would you like me to do first?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2545,Yes.,HOWARD,PENNY
2546,"Yeah, good for you.",LEONARD,RAJ
2547,"Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?",PENNY,SHELDON
2548,"I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2549,It should be me.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2550,I invited him.,SHELDON,PENNY
2551,That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2552,"You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?",PENNY,LEONARD
2553,"No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.",HOWARD,HOWARD
2554,Where did you get all this stuff?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2555,"Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2556,Let me finish.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2557,And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2558,"There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.",SHELDON,PENNY
2559,"That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me.",RAJ,RAJ
2560,Maybe.,LEONARD,OTHERS
2561,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
2562,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2563,That’s what I’m afraid of.,PENNY,SHELDON
2564,"My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful.",RAJ,SHELDON
2565,Why don’t you show me yours first.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2566,You think they’ll still go on the trip?,LEONARD,HOWARD
2567,"Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2568,"Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine.",PENNY,LEONARD
2569,Not me.,HOWARD,OTHERS
2570,Thank you. Is someone smoking?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2571,You’ve really got to get out more.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2572,Agreed.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2573,I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.,LEONARD,RAJ
2574,"Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2575,We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2576,"I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2577,"Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed.",RAJ,PENNY
2578,"On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2579,"Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2580,"You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",RAJ,SHELDON
2581,I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.,RAJ,SHELDON
2582,Yep.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2583,"Trust me, I, I remember.",OTHERS,PENNY
2584,Hi Mike.,PENNY,SHELDON
2585,"No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?",LEONARD,SHELDON
2586,"His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2587,"Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.",PENNY,SHELDON
2588,You have a desk.,RAJ,PENNY
2589,"Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.",RAJ,LEONARD
2590,Thank you for understanding.,SHELDON,OTHERS
2591,"I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2592,How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?,SHELDON,PENNY
2593,250 million years.,RAJ,SHELDON
2594,All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.,SHELDON,RAJ
2595,Keep the table. We don’t use that space.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2596,No kidding?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2597,Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2598,"You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended.",HOWARD,PENNY
2599,What now?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2600,"Well, do you know anybody?",PENNY,HOWARD
2601,"I am, I’m really proud.",LEONARD,PENNY
2602,"Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2603,Alright then.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2604,"It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2605,"Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2606,"Uh, that, that’s not necessary.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2607,"You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.",PENNY,SHELDON
2608,"Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.",PENNY,LEONARD
2609,It was like a grapefruit.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2610,I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?,SHELDON,HOWARD
2611,Hey.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2612,"He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2613,I can’t watch anymore.,RAJ,SHELDON
2614,That doesn’t paint me in the best light.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2615,Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2616,What?,LEONARD,HOWARD
2617,Thanks.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2618,I prefer to think of myself as quirky.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2619,"No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2620,That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2621,"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.",SHELDON,PENNY
2622,"I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?",PENNY,HOWARD
2623,Except for Raj.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2624,"This is what I’m talking about.  Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…",OTHERS,PENNY
2625,"Yeah, me, too.",PENNY,SHELDON
2626,On Sunday?,SHELDON,OTHERS
2627,"Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2628,"It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.",LEONARD,PENNY
2629,"Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?",OTHERS,LEONARD
2630,"Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2631,"Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.",SHELDON,PENNY
2632,"Come on, do I have to think of everything?",HOWARD,SHELDON
2633,I don’t know what colour lonely is.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2634,"We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2635,Esther Rosenblatt.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2636,"Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2637,But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2638,"You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2639,What are you doing?,RAJ,OTHERS
2640,I’m ready.,SHELDON,OTHERS
2641,"Hey, what’s going on?",RAJ,LEONARD
2642,"Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.",SHELDON,PENNY
2643,"Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh.",PENNY,SHELDON
2644,"Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.",RAJ,LEONARD
2645,I’m so sorry.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2646,But none of that means we don’t love you.,OTHERS,HOWARD
2647,"Plus, I, I think I’m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won’t know where I went or if I’m ever coming back. That’ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2648,"No, I haven’t.",PENNY,HOWARD
2649,"I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…",RAJ,SHELDON
2650,"Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.",RAJ,OTHERS
2651,Here’s the problem with teleportation.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2652,Keep going.,RAJ,SHELDON
2653,"A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?",RAJ,PENNY
2654,I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.,RAJ,LEONARD
2655,"Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.",PENNY,RAJ
2656,"Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.",PENNY,SHELDON
2657,"Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2658,Hello.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2659,"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?",SHELDON,LEONARD
2660,No.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2661,"He can’t kill me, even if I turn.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2662,"We are. But I was hoping, maybe…",OTHERS,PENNY
2663,I guess this could count as an adventure.,LEONARD,PENNY
2664,Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being.,LEONARD,PENNY
2665,"Sorry, I left them in my turban.",RAJ,HOWARD
2666,You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.,SHELDON,RAJ
2667,"So, how do we start?",OTHERS,PENNY
2668,"Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?",PENNY,LEONARD
2669,"Well, astrophysicist.",RAJ,LEONARD
2670,You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?,PENNY,SHELDON
2671,"Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2672,"I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2673,"Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2674,Great.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2675,"Right. Sorry, sir.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2676,Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?,LEONARD,SHELDON
2677,That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.,OTHERS,PENNY
2678,I think I’m hysterical.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2679,"There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?",HOWARD,RAJ
2680,"You know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2681,"If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.",LEONARD,HOWARD
2682,"Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.",RAJ,HOWARD
2683,"Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2684,Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2685,That sounds fun.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2686,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2687,And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.,PENNY,PENNY
2688,It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2689,Mine.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2690,"Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.",RAJ,LEONARD
2691,All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2692,"So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?",RAJ,SHELDON
2693,How many?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2694,Are you going to be sarcastic?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2695,"Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.",PENNY,LEONARD
2696,"Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?",RAJ,LEONARD
2697,Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?,LEONARD,PENNY
2698,Hi.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2699,It’s important.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2700,"No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be.",PENNY,RAJ
2701,How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?,SHELDON,RAJ
2702,Will you listen to me play my harp now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2703,Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.,SHELDON,PENNY
2704,"I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.",LEONARD,PENNY
2705,"Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2706,Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2707,"Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2708,"Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.",SHELDON,PENNY
2709,I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2710,"Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2711,"It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it?",LEONARD,PENNY
2712,"Really? I mean, are you sure?",PENNY,HOWARD
2713,You have got to be kidding me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2714,"Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge.",PENNY,LEONARD
2715,Got it.,PENNY,LEONARD
2716,Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?,SHELDON,HOWARD
2717,Give me back my parking space.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2718,"Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy.",HOWARD,RAJ
2719,How can reading my journal be an accident?,PENNY,SHELDON
2720,"Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2721,"I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2722,"So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2723,Had will have placed?,LEONARD,RAJ
2724,Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.,SHELDON,PENNY
2725,No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2726,"Ooh, strike three.",PENNY,LEONARD
2727,"Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2728,"Hey, you got a minute?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2729,"Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.",RAJ,HOWARD
2730,So you’re not judging me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2731,"No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2732,"Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.",RAJ,PENNY
2733,"Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2734,What’s it doing in my apartment?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2735,Ah.,RAJ,SHELDON
2736,"Just a sec.  The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it’s a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I’ll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I’ll see you then.  Hello?",PENNY,PENNY
2737,"Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2738,"Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2739,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
2740,Still get in.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2741,Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper’s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.,OTHERS,PENNY
2742,"Gentlemen, goggles.",HOWARD,OTHERS
2743,Why? What’s the problem?,LEONARD,SHELDON

2746,"Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?",PENNY,PENNY
2747,"No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick.",PENNY,SHELDON
2748,Also no.,PENNY,SHELDON
2749,That’s just the booze talking.,PENNY,SHELDON
2750,Because you keep saying who.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2751,Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2752,Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2753,"Hey, where have you been?",LEONARD,RAJ
2754,We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2755,At six-thirty in the morning?,SHELDON,HOWARD
2756,"I’m listening, amuse me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2757,So don’t call her.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2758,"You know, I’m sorry.",PENNY,LEONARD
2759,Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!,SHELDON,SHELDON
2760,I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2761,You live with your mother?,HOWARD,RAJ
2762,That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?,PENNY,OTHERS
2763,Leonard has a lady over.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2764,So who wants to rent Fiddler?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2765,I brought sparkling cider.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2766,Sure.,RAJ,SHELDON
2767,"Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.",PENNY,LEONARD
2768,It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.,LEONARD,OTHERS
2769,I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?,SHELDON,PENNY
2770,It’s not funny.,PENNY,SHELDON
2771,Does yours have wet bweasts in it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2772,It’s very nice to meet you.,OTHERS,RAJ
2773,"Sheldon, sit!",LEONARD,SHELDON
2774,I don’t know. What do you want me to do?,LEONARD,PENNY
2775,"Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.",PENNY,LEONARD
2776,You didn’t even let me finish.,SHELDON,PENNY
2777,"I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2778,"Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2779,"Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.",RAJ,SHELDON
2780,"I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.",OTHERS,OTHERS
2781,"Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2782,He wants more money.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2783,"Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?",PENNY,RAJ
2784,We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.,PENNY,LEONARD
2785,How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2786,"No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2787,"To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2788,"One second. Okay, I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?",RAJ,PENNY
2789,No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2790,Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.,PENNY,LEONARD
2791,You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2792,You guys are being jerks.,RAJ,PENNY
2793,And that’s still good for you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2794,I want grilled cheese.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2795,"He probably stole his wallet, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2796,"You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2797,"Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2798,There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.,PENNY,SHELDON

2802,"I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how’s Sheldon doing?",RAJ,RAJ
2803,Do you know what? It’s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It’s all I need to give my life meaning.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2804,"Sorry it’s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2805,"Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2806,"Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?",LEONARD,LEONARD
2807,"You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2808,I thought things were going well. What happened?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2809,Can I see that?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2810,You okay?,PENNY,SHELDON
2811,"You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2812,"Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2813,"Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2814,Uh-huh.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2815,"So, you got any special plans with your sister?",HOWARD,PENNY
2816,You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.,PENNY,SHELDON
2817,I’m not sure.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2818,"Well, me, neither.",RAJ,SHELDON
2819,"All right. Now, I’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2820,"A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2821,Drink whatever you want.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2822,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2823,I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2824,"Okay, be nice.",PENNY,LEONARD
2825,"I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2826,"Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.",PENNY,LEONARD
2827,"Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.",LEONARD,OTHERS
2828,We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.,OTHERS,SHELDON
2829,"Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2830,"Oh, I miss you, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2831,"Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.",RAJ,SHELDON
2832,"Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.",PENNY,LEONARD
2833,What did I do?,PENNY,RAJ
2834,It’s only for five weeks.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2835,You’re just misappropriating my understanding.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2836,Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2837,Making the extra effort. Good for you.,SHELDON,RAJ
2838,Your mom having fun in Florida?,OTHERS,PENNY
2839,"No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.",LEONARD,RAJ
2840,Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.,OTHERS,OTHERS

2842,"Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!",RAJ,SHELDON
2843,You do that?,PENNY,LEONARD
2844,"Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2845,"Yeah, I said I’d think about it.",PENNY,OTHERS
2846,May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2847,"Yeah, I know, tell me about it.",PENNY,LEONARD
2848,"I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2849,Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.,RAJ,SHELDON
2850,I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2851,Actually that was last year.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2852,"No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like.",SHELDON,RAJ
2853,Thank you for the clarification.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2854,"So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?",OTHERS,LEONARD

2857,"Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?",OTHERS,LEONARD

2859,Can I see the roommate agreement?,OTHERS,LEONARD
2860,"Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2861,Excuse me.,PENNY,PENNY
2862,I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2863,"Oh, my God, that is so creepy!",PENNY,SHELDON
2864,I kind of have other plans tonight.,LEONARD,RAJ
2865,"Uh, the couch is good.",PENNY,PENNY
2866,Seriously?,HOWARD,LEONARD
2867,It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2868,The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2869,Weekends are too crowded.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2870,Hello-lo-lo.,RAJ,OTHERS
2871,I’m sorry things turned out this way.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2872,"No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.",PENNY,SHELDON
2873,"No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2874,"Well, no wonder the women are winning.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2875,"Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2876,You’re joking.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2877,I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2878,"Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.",PENNY,SHELDON
2879,Thank you.,LEONARD,HOWARD
2880,Sheldon.  Sheldon.  Sheldon.,PENNY,LEONARD
2881,"Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2882,"Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.",PENNY,HOWARD
2883,I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
2884,Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2885,Leonard?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2886,"Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.",PENNY,LEONARD
2887,"No, still hideous.",PENNY,SHELDON
2888,"All right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2889,I don’t know.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2890,Oh!,PENNY,LEONARD
2891,That’s exactly what I told him.,SHELDON,SHELDON
2892,You’re welcome.,SHELDON,OTHERS
2893,"Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2894,Not really.,LEONARD,PENNY
2895,"Okay, now that I’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight.",PENNY,LEONARD
2896,Amy wants me to have it.,PENNY,RAJ
2897,I’m not saying that.,LEONARD,RAJ
2898,You said you were going for a walk.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2899,Well?,HOWARD,SHELDON
2900,"Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?",PENNY,SHELDON
2901,"Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?",HOWARD,PENNY
2902,And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.,RAJ,HOWARD
2903,"Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let’s just… Sheldon, please,",PENNY,SHELDON
2904,Mmm. Thank you.,OTHERS,PENNY
2905,No. We failed in our noble quest.,SHELDON,RAJ
2906,"My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2907,"See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
2908,Okay.,OTHERS,LEONARD
2909,What are you doing?,LEONARD,PENNY
2910,"Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2911,"It’s very impressive, for theoretical work.",OTHERS,LEONARD
2912,"Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?",OTHERS,HOWARD
2913,Told yah!.,PENNY,OTHERS
2914,Are you a homosexual?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2915,Hmm.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2916,It’s fine. And also not true.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2917,"Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.",LEONARD,PENNY
2918,‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.,HOWARD,LEONARD
2919,"Fine, faint.",PENNY,LEONARD
2920,I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2921,Don’t start with me dude.,RAJ,LEONARD
2922,"No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!",OTHERS,LEONARD
2923,What’s all this?,LEONARD,OTHERS
2924,"No, I got it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2925,"You’re kidding, right?",SHELDON,OTHERS
2926,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?,SHELDON,PENNY
2927,"I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.",OTHERS,PENNY
2928,"Wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?",PENNY,SHELDON
2929,I’ll do it.,RAJ,SHELDON
2930,"We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2931,There’s a tree on you.,PENNY,LEONARD
2932,Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2933,"What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.",HOWARD,LEONARD
2934,"Actually, it’s the three of us.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2935,Excuse me?,PENNY,OTHERS
2936,"Okay, well, good night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2937,"Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.",PENNY,SHELDON
2938,"Oh, God.",PENNY,LEONARD
2939,"Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2940,"What about you, Penny?",OTHERS,SHELDON
2941,Not as much as you.,LEONARD,RAJ
2942,Do you want him back?,PENNY,RAJ
2943,"Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.",PENNY,OTHERS
2944,"Well, then don’t go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
2945,But it’s beautiful.,RAJ,PENNY
2946,"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?",SHELDON,HOWARD
2947,"Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things.",SHELDON,HOWARD
2948,That’s actually my napkin.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2949,What are you doing?,PENNY,PENNY
2950,"Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2951,"Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?",HOWARD,HOWARD
2952,"I’m sorry, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2953,"No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2954,"Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?",HOWARD,LEONARD
2955,What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?,OTHERS,SHELDON
2956,"Oh, thank you.",SHELDON,RAJ
2957,"Oh, really?",PENNY,LEONARD
2958,"Leonard, didn’t we have this conversation five years ago.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2959,Nice little bot you’ve got here.,LEONARD,SHELDON
2960,Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.,SHELDON,LEONARD
2961,We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
2962,What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.,RAJ,LEONARD
2963,"Yeah, and don’t you forget it.",LEONARD,RAJ
2964,"Oh, wow, is the evening over.",PENNY,LEONARD
2965,I need some fresh air.,HOWARD,SHELDON
2966,"You said you told her, but you never did!",OTHERS,SHELDON
2967,Right.,LEONARD,PENNY
2968,"And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind.",SHELDON,SHELDON
2969,Yep. I got to get a home gym.,OTHERS,PENNY
2970,The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?,SHELDON,LEONARD
2971,Damn it!,PENNY,LEONARD
2972,What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?,PENNY,SHELDON
2973,"No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich.",SHELDON,OTHERS
2974,What exactly does that mean?,PENNY,SHELDON
2975,My point.,SHELDON,HOWARD
2976,"Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.",PENNY,PENNY
2977,I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.,LEONARD,RAJ
2978,"I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world.",LEONARD,RAJ
2979,"No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.",OTHERS,PENNY
2980,To your dad.,OTHERS,PENNY
2981,"No, you have to stop now.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2982,"You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.",RAJ,HOWARD
2983,"Oh, that’s awful.",PENNY,SHELDON
2984,"Well, you’re having one with me.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2985,"My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.",PENNY,RAJ
2986,"Sit down, we want to talk to you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2987,"Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?",SHELDON,SHELDON
2988,Will someone take me home?,SHELDON,SHELDON
2989,Oh.,SHELDON,RAJ
2990,Sheldon doesn’t work here.,PENNY,PENNY
2991,"Uh, I left my phone downstairs.",OTHERS,HOWARD
2992,"Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2993,"Oh, wow, cool.",LEONARD,LEONARD
2994,"I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.",OTHERS,SHELDON
2995,"Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…",SHELDON,LEONARD
2996,Sometimes I forget how smart you are.,PENNY,PENNY
2997,"Oh, God. I think someone’s following us.",HOWARD,SHELDON
2998,I know. I’m still learning to control it.,SHELDON,RAJ
2999,"Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.",PENNY,SHELDON
3000,Have you considered massage?,OTHERS,PENNY
3001,So when do you guys plan on getting married?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3002,"Hi, I’m the small package good things come in.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3003,"Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3004,"Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?",PENNY,SHELDON
3005,"Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3006,"Sheldon, wait! Will you?",PENNY,SHELDON
3007,What does your gut tell you?,PENNY,SHELDON
3008,They must’ve cut it.,PENNY,SHELDON
3009,"No, you’re not.",PENNY,PENNY
3010,What is it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3011,"Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3012,"That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3013,Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?,SHELDON,PENNY
3014,You’re not going to answer it?,SHELDON,RAJ
3015,"Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.",LEONARD,HOWARD
3016,But what about the creek bed?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3017,"I will, I’m just working on my opening line.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3018,Welcome to Team Putz.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3019,"Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3020,Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3021,"I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.  I trust you paid off those parking tickets.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3022,"No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3023,Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3024,"Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…",LEONARD,LEONARD
3025,"So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3026,Yeah.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3027,"Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.",PENNY,SHELDON
3028,"Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?",PENNY,SHELDON
3029,"Well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.",PENNY,SHELDON
3030,"Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3031,"Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3032,How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?,OTHERS,RAJ
3033,"Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3034,Really? What was your first clue?,PENNY,LEONARD
3035,Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3036,"Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.",PENNY,LEONARD
3037,"Thank you, Daddy.",OTHERS,PENNY
3038,I love it!,OTHERS,HOWARD
3039,And a lovely Valentine’s Day.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3040,"Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!",SHELDON,HOWARD
3041,"I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.",RAJ,PENNY
3042,"Relax, it’ll be fine.",HOWARD,PENNY
3043,"Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3044,Like you could get a brown bear.,PENNY,PENNY
3045,"This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3046,"Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend.",PENNY,PENNY
3047,"I missed you, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3048,Midnight.,PENNY,LEONARD
3049,Do you hear yourself,HOWARD,SHELDON
3050,Wow.,PENNY,RAJ
3051,Play with your phone.,OTHERS,PENNY
3052,That’s nice.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3053,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
3054,"I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.",RAJ,SHELDON
3055,"Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?",LEONARD,PENNY
3056,"Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3057,"Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3058,"Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3059,"Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.",LEONARD,PENNY
3060,Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.,LEONARD,RAJ
3061,"Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3062,"I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure.",PENNY,SHELDON
3063,"Come on, is that really necessary?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3064,So sad.,HOWARD,PENNY
3065,"Well, that was fun.",PENNY,HOWARD
3066,"You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
3067,He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3068,Interesting. Very interesting.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3069,"Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?",SHELDON,LEONARD
3070,I’m proud of you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3071,I’ll miss you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3072,"Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3073,"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3074,Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3075,"Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.",LEONARD,HOWARD
3076,I guess not.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3077,"Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?",LEONARD,HOWARD
3078,"Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.",RAJ,SHELDON
3079,"What? Hey, hey! Come back here!",LEONARD,SHELDON
3080,"Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?",SHELDON,PENNY
3081,"All right, I’ll keep an eye out for that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3082,No?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3083,"I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3084,"Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common.",PENNY,PENNY
3085,"Uh, fifteen…",LEONARD,LEONARD
3086,"Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?",OTHERS,SHELDON
3087,"Ooh, how far into the future?",RAJ,HOWARD
3088,I get it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3089,"No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3090,This is kind of hot.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3091,"It’s not that I want to go, I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.",PENNY,SHELDON
3092,Are you upset about something?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3093,"Sweetie, put the pants on.",PENNY,PENNY
3094,"Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3095,Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?,OTHERS,RAJ
3096,Wonder what she saw in that guy.,RAJ,OTHERS
3097,Just say it.,RAJ,SHELDON
3098,Why?,RAJ,SHELDON
3099,"Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3100,"Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3101,Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?,RAJ,OTHERS
3102,"Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3103,A Milk Dud?,RAJ,SHELDON
3104,"Yeah, great.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3105,Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3106,"Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?",RAJ,LEONARD
3107,"Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3108,Exactly.,PENNY,SHELDON
3109,"Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3110,Eating cake on the toilet single.,RAJ,SHELDON
3111,"Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3112,"Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.",PENNY,PENNY
3113,And helping people.,PENNY,LEONARD
3114,"Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3115,And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3116,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3117,This was nice.,RAJ,SHELDON
3118,"Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.",LEONARD,PENNY
3119,"Uh, he….",PENNY,HOWARD
3120,"Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.",RAJ,LEONARD
3121,"No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3122,"Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3123,"Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.",SHELDON,PENNY
3124,You have a beautiful voice.,RAJ,HOWARD
3125,"You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up.",PENNY,SHELDON
3126,"Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3127,No. Did she seem upset to you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3128,Does he ever shut up?,OTHERS,PENNY
3129,"Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3130,"Let me ask you something, Bernie.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3131,I wasn’t gonna get beat up.,LEONARD,HOWARD
3132,Yes. On purpose.,PENNY,LEONARD
3133,He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3134,"Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3135,"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3136,One day. Right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3137,It’s a good thing you’re cute.,SHELDON,PENNY
3138,That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3139,A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.,SHELDON,HOWARD
3140,What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.,RAJ,LEONARD
3141,I’m all out.,RAJ,LEONARD
3142,"Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?",PENNY,LEONARD
3143,"You mean, like a pinky swear?",PENNY,LEONARD
3144,You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3145,Where on earth did you get that from?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3146,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3147,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3148,"Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.",LEONARD,PENNY
3149,I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3150,And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3151,"We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.",RAJ,PENNY
3152,I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.,RAJ,LEONARD
3153,Check.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3154,"Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”",LEONARD,PENNY
3155,I totally had one of those.,RAJ,LEONARD
3156,‘Cause that’s what we do.,RAJ,PENNY
3157,"You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3158,Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3159,"Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun.",LEONARD,PENNY
3160,You got it.,HOWARD,RAJ
3161,I should probably go.,PENNY,PENNY
3162,"Raj, Raj, wait.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3163,"No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3164,Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3165,Stay.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3166,"Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.",LEONARD,PENNY
3167,"Well, which is it?",PENNY,SHELDON
3168,What happened to the rest of your group?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3169,"Yeah, you probably had it coming.",PENNY,LEONARD
3170,"No, but you are, so I got you this as a present.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3171,"Well, we’re having everyone over.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3172,"Gosh, Penny, what’d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3173,Really? That’s the importance you put on us having a baby?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3174,Come in.,PENNY,LEONARD
3175,You can have soup delivered.,PENNY,LEONARD
3176,Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3177,"I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3178,Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3179,And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3180,He can never know that I gave that to you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3181,I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.,RAJ,SHELDON
3182,"Well, we sort of decided to wing it.",LEONARD,PENNY
3183,And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.,PENNY,SHELDON
3184,And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3185,It wasn’t on?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3186,"Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3187,"They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3188,That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.,HOWARD,PENNY
3189,"Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?",HOWARD,SHELDON
3190,"By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3191,"Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?",OTHERS,LEONARD
3192,Want me to leave?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3193,Just kissing.,PENNY,SHELDON
3194,"Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.",LEONARD,PENNY
3195,"Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.",RAJ,SHELDON
3196,"I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.",LEONARD,HOWARD
3197,Couple of questions about the plaque.,SHELDON,OTHERS
3198,Oh. How was it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3199,And that is?,PENNY,LEONARD
3200,"Well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3201,"I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman.",LEONARD,PENNY
3202,"Actually, it’s making me dizzy.",HOWARD,HOWARD
3203,"Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.",PENNY,LEONARD
3204,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3205,"After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3206,How’s your leg?,PENNY,PENNY
3207,I got to get back to work. I love you.,OTHERS,HOWARD
3208,"Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?",SHELDON,LEONARD
3209,"Holy crap, are we nerdy.",RAJ,PENNY
3210,"Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.",RAJ,OTHERS
3211,"Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those.",PENNY,PENNY
3212,"Yeah, like she could get Trent.",RAJ,LEONARD
3213,"Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don’t know, pleasant?",PENNY,SHELDON
3214,My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.,SHELDON,PENNY
3215,"Okay, I don’t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.",PENNY,LEONARD
3216,I guess I just miss when life was simpler.,PENNY,SHELDON
3217,Here you go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3218,No.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3219,Wha??,SHELDON,PENNY
3220,See? Better with the accent.,RAJ,OTHERS
3221,"That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire.",LEONARD,PENNY
3222,You’re only making it seem more real for me.,RAJ,SHELDON
3223,"Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3224,Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3225,That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3226,No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.,RAJ,OTHERS
3227,"Well, you don’t like it?",PENNY,LEONARD
3228,"Relax. Everything’s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3229,I smell robot.,HOWARD,PENNY
3230,"Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3231,"What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.",RAJ,HOWARD
3232,"No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3233,Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3234,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.,SHELDON,PENNY
3235,"Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.",PENNY,SHELDON
3236,And what would that be?,LEONARD,RAJ
3237,Then get the other one. Pass the butter.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3238,I’ll check his room.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3239,"Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed.",LEONARD,PENNY
3240,"Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that.",SHELDON,PENNY
3241,"I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I’m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3242,"Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3243,Apparently so.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3244,"Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.",PENNY,SHELDON
3245,Did you read it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3246,Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.,OTHERS,RAJ
3247,"Fine, I’ll change.",HOWARD,RAJ
3248,"All right. Well, what should we talk about?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3249,We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.,LEONARD,PENNY
3250,120?,PENNY,SHELDON
3251,He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3252,"Okay, you can take him for shoes.",PENNY,HOWARD
3253,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…",SHELDON,LEONARD
3254,"I don’t have epilepsy, either.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3255,"Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!",SHELDON,SHELDON
3256,I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.,SHELDON,PENNY
3257,Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3258,Is it? Listen.,SHELDON,HOWARD
3259,"Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3260,"Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.  That’s it, now just keep true. Alright, you’re close enough to Sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3261,"Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3262,Anything?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3263,"Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?",OTHERS,LEONARD
3264,"Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.",SHELDON,PENNY
3265,"Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3266,"Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.",PENNY,LEONARD
3267,"Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3268,Little more. No. That’s got it.,OTHERS,PENNY
3269,"Um, why would I mean Alex?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3270,"You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?",HOWARD,RAJ
3271,You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.,SHELDON,PENNY
3272,"Okay, all I’m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.",PENNY,OTHERS
3273,"Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger.",PENNY,LEONARD
3274,"Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.",HOWARD,RAJ
3275,"Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.",OTHERS,PENNY
3276,"Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.",RAJ,SHELDON
3277,Correct.,SHELDON,PENNY
3278,"Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can’t come true.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3279,"Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.",PENNY,OTHERS
3280,He doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.,LEONARD,PENNY
3281,"Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3282,"I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3283,"If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3284,"No, I want this to be romantic.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3285,"Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.",RAJ,LEONARD
3286,That’s not an apology.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3287,We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.,SHELDON,OTHERS
3288,"I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…",SHELDON,LEONARD
3289,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3290,"She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.",RAJ,LEONARD
3291,"Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.",PENNY,SHELDON
3292,Hello.,SHELDON,RAJ
3293,"Well, then Raj and I will…",SHELDON,SHELDON
3294,You’re lucky I didn’t run you over.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3295,Merry Christmas.,PENNY,HOWARD
3296,"Well, you don’t go into science for the money.",LEONARD,HOWARD
3297,He’s having problems with Stephanie?,PENNY,HOWARD
3298,"A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3299,You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.,HOWARD,PENNY
3300,"Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3301,"All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?",PENNY,SHELDON
3302,"I was analysing our lie, and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3303,"Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3304,"Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?",OTHERS,RAJ
3305,It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.,SHELDON,HOWARD
3306,"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3307,"Red Leader, I’m really sorry.",PENNY,PENNY
3308,Great.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3309,"Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they’re so cute…",PENNY,PENNY
3310,She was attempting to engage me in gossip.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3311,"Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.",OTHERS,PENNY
3312,"Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.",SHELDON,PENNY
3313,"So as they say, all good things must come to an end.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3314,Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3315,"When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?",RAJ,LEONARD
3316,You gonna buy another round for the house?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3317,Thanks for walking me to my car.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3318,"Ah, there’s definitely some oak.",PENNY,SHELDON
3319,"Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.",PENNY,OTHERS
3320,"She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.",PENNY,PENNY
3321,"Well, then, what do you want?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3322,"Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3323,So what can I do for you?,OTHERS,HOWARD
3324,Megan Pincus.,RAJ,SHELDON
3325,No.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3326,"Welcome aboard, old chum.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3327,"All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?",PENNY,SHELDON
3328,Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.,PENNY,LEONARD
3329,"It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?",LEONARD,HOWARD
3330,"Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3331,"She’s kidding, right?",RAJ,SHELDON
3332,"Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.",PENNY,HOWARD
3333,Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?,RAJ,RAJ
3334,"Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3335,You know that hurts my feelings.,RAJ,PENNY
3336,That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3337,"Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?",HOWARD,SHELDON
3338,Should we give them their privacy?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3339,"I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3340,Search for it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3341,"No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.",PENNY,LEONARD
3342,He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3343,"But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.",LEONARD,HOWARD
3344,"Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?",PENNY,OTHERS
3345,Prostitute.,RAJ,SHELDON
3346,"That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!",SHELDON,SHELDON
3347,I don’t think so.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3348,I’ll run lines with you in the car.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3349,"Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.",RAJ,SHELDON
3350,Then it’s settled.,PENNY,SHELDON
3351,I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.,PENNY,RAJ
3352,It was just a suggestion.,RAJ,LEONARD

3357,"I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.",PENNY,LEONARD
3358,"But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.",RAJ,LEONARD

3360,That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3361,There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3362,"Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?",OTHERS,HOWARD

3381,"Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself.

3423,"Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling.

3476,Yeah?,LEONARD,SHELDON

3478,You okay?,PENNY,PENNY
3479,No.,LEONARD,PENNY

3481,You did?,LEONARD,PENNY
3482,"I don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue.

3483,No.,LEONARD,PENNY

3490,"Oh, and how.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3491,"Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3492,"That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?",HOWARD,PENNY
3493,"Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3494,I’ve never been to a funeral before.,PENNY,HOWARD

3504,"Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.",LEONARD,PENNY
3505,Your apology is not accepted.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3506,I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3507,"Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3508,I’m not hitting on her.,SHELDON,RAJ
3509,"Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing?",SHELDON,LEONARD
3510,"Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3511,Yay!,PENNY,HOWARD
3512,Would you like an autograph?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3513,I don’t know. Seek professional help?,HOWARD,PENNY
3514,We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.,HOWARD,PENNY
3515,"Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.",SHELDON,SHELDON

3522,"Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?",PENNY,SHELDON
3523,That’s not true.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3524,You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3525,"No, I do. Eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me.",SHELDON,RAJ
3526,I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3527,We do?,PENNY,LEONARD

3534,And you know about that stuff?,PENNY,SHELDON
3535,Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3536,"I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3537,I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3538,"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet.  Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.",SHELDON,PENNY
3539,She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3540,Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?,SHELDON,LEONARD

3543,What….,LEONARD,SHELDON
3544,Sure.,OTHERS,PENNY
3545,"I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.",SHELDON,PENNY
3546,"Oh, no. You have to go.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3547,We’re the Justice League of America. There’s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3548,Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3549,"No, it doesn’t.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3550,You could die.,OTHERS,HOWARD
3551,Correct.,SHELDON,PENNY
3552,"Well, I’m not getting in bed with him.",PENNY,PENNY
3553,I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?,LEONARD,HOWARD
3554,I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3555,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3556,That’s what I said.,SHELDON,PENNY
3557,"I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3558,"Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?",SHELDON,SHELDON
3559,"Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.",RAJ,PENNY

3561,And I may have hit on her a little bit.,LEONARD,PENNY
3562,"I speak sign language, I don’t read minds.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3563,"Also, uh, cherries?",RAJ,LEONARD
3564,"Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3565,Good night.,LEONARD,RAJ
3566,What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3567,"I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3568,"Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3569,"Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.",PENNY,LEONARD
3570,"Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.",PENNY,HOWARD
3571,"I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3572,"Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.",RAJ,PENNY
3573,"Well, you’re kidding, right?",RAJ,SHELDON
3574,"Excuse me, spoiler alert.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3575,That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3576,"Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket.",HOWARD,PENNY
3577,"Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3578,"Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.",LEONARD,RAJ
3579,What’s the point of that story?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3580,What’s wrong with cute?,PENNY,PENNY
3581,What? You were all going as the Hulk?,PENNY,LEONARD
3582,"Hey, you.",LEONARD,PENNY
3583,It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.,LEONARD,OTHERS
3584,"Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.",PENNY,LEONARD
3585,"All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3586,"What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.",RAJ,HOWARD
3587,Are you willing to risk it?,RAJ,SHELDON
3588,"So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?",PENNY,RAJ
3589,"Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3590,I’m sorry?,PENNY,SHELDON
3591,I could go for a drink.,OTHERS,OTHERS
3592,"So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.",LEONARD,PENNY
3593,You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3594,They’re not going on the trip.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3595,I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.,HOWARD,PENNY

3597,"Nah, she’s a good kid.",SHELDON,LEONARD

3603,"Oh, one sec.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3604,Gladly. Can we storm out?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3605,That’s great.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3606,"Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3607,"Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3608,Okay.,OTHERS,SHELDON

3614,I know.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3615,I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine!  We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious.  Where’s the ring?,SHELDON,RAJ
3616,Ready.,LEONARD,PENNY
3617,"Oh, okay, okay, calm down.  It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3618,"No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.",PENNY,SHELDON
3619,"Hi, bestie.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3620,"I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark.",RAJ,SHELDON
3621,Wow. Didn’t see that coming.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3622,"Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!",LEONARD,PENNY
3623,"Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?",RAJ,PENNY
3624,Thanks for the heads up.,HOWARD,SHELDON
3625,Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my  14! Yes!,OTHERS,PENNY
3626,Certainly. Good night.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3627,Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.,LEONARD,OTHERS
3628,"I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3629,"Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.",RAJ,LEONARD
3630,You look like you come with a kickstand.,HOWARD,PENNY
3631,Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?,HOWARD,HOWARD
3632,"No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.",LEONARD,PENNY
3633,"Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3634,Are you sure you want to do this?,LEONARD,OTHERS
3635,Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3636,"Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.",LEONARD,OTHERS
3637,Perhaps this was a waste of time.,SHELDON,PENNY
3638,I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.,SHELDON,PENNY
3639,Wild thang.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3640,"Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.",SHELDON,HOWARD

3646,"Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened.",PENNY,PENNY
3647,I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3648,"Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.",SHELDON,RAJ
3649,I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?,LEONARD,SHELDON

3651,It might be good for him.,PENNY,PENNY

3653,This is kind of creepy.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3654,"Well, well, we might want to live together.",LEONARD,PENNY
3655,"Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.",RAJ,PENNY

3660,Just come in.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3661,Watch whatever you want.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3662,"Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?",OTHERS,LEONARD
3663,"So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3664,"One, two, three, eat.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3665,"Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3666,"Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3667,Right now would be good.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3668,Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.,OTHERS,PENNY

3670,"Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?",OTHERS,SHELDON
3671,Who wouldn’t?,LEONARD,PENNY
3672,"Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3673,Do any of them work?,PENNY,PENNY
3674,"Hello, Michaela.",RAJ,SHELDON
3675,It’s not flattery if it’s the truth.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3676,Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.,OTHERS,PENNY
3677,Love?,PENNY,SHELDON
3678,Damn.,RAJ,PENNY
3679,Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?,LEONARD,PENNY

3681,My bug report to you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3682,"What do you think about it, Sheldon?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3683,Okay. Great. How do you want to start?,LEONARD,RAJ
3684,Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.,SHELDON,HOWARD
3685,Riddle me this…,PENNY,LEONARD
3686,"Sorry, I had to clock out.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3687,He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.,OTHERS,PENNY
3688,"Oh, come on, like you even care.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3689,So where are we going?,RAJ,SHELDON
3690,I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3691,"Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
3692,Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3693,"How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.",LEONARD,PENNY
3694,I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.,HOWARD,PENNY
3695,"Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I’ve done some stupid things, you’ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?",PENNY,LEONARD
3696,"I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?",RAJ,LEONARD
3697,"Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?",PENNY,LEONARD
3698,Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3699,"I took a shot, sue me.",OTHERS,PENNY
3700,"Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3701,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3702,"Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.",PENNY,SHELDON
3703,Are you currently pregnant?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3704,"I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3705,"Okay, yeah, fine.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3706,"I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.",LEONARD,OTHERS
3707,"All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3708,Army Ants.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3709,"Sheldon, she’s fine.",RAJ,LEONARD
3710,This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?,PENNY,HOWARD
3711,"Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?",OTHERS,PENNY
3712,Not as little as you’d want him to be.,OTHERS,PENNY
3713,"Howard? Howard? It’s me, it’s just me.",RAJ,OTHERS
3714,"Ooh, I do love a bad boy.",OTHERS,SHELDON

3719,Lobsters overnight?,LEONARD,SHELDON
3720,"Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.",RAJ,LEONARD
3721,She’s very real.,RAJ,LEONARD
3722,Even you. You’re a slave.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3723,Want of understanding? What does that even mean?,PENNY,LEONARD
3724,What is it?,HOWARD,SHELDON
3725,"Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3726,I did.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3727,"I’m not sure, it could go either way.",SHELDON,PENNY
3728,"Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.",PENNY,SHELDON
3729,Sure.,PENNY,SHELDON
3730,"Okay, just checking.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3731,I’m actually more of a theorist.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3732,It’s not.,PENNY,SHELDON
3733,What’s going on with you?,OTHERS,PENNY
3734,"Okay, here.",SHELDON,RAJ
3735,"So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?",HOWARD,RAJ
3736,You’re kidding.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3737,Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.,RAJ,SHELDON
3738,Goodbye Leonard!,PENNY,PENNY
3739,You mean before you give it to me?,OTHERS,PENNY
3740,Oy vay.,HOWARD,HOWARD

3744,"Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.",LEONARD,RAJ
3745,What?,OTHERS,OTHERS
3746,We both know this one’s gonna win.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3747,"Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way.",PENNY,LEONARD
3748,"Hey, you got a sec?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3749,He was the host of this great… Hey!,LEONARD,PENNY
3750,Maybe he didn’t notice.,PENNY,SHELDON
3751,Maybe we should start with that.,OTHERS,PENNY
3752,He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.,PENNY,PENNY
3753,"I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?",RAJ,SHELDON
3754,"Well, I’m in. When are we going?",PENNY,SHELDON
3755,"Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?",OTHERS,SHELDON
3756,But wait. So does this one.,PENNY,LEONARD
3757,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.,SHELDON,RAJ
3758,"Click it with me. One, two, three, click.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3759,Our tango?,PENNY,SHELDON
3760,"Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.",LEONARD,PENNY
3761,"Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.",PENNY,RAJ
3762,The walls are getting slower.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3763,Got it. Just had to check.,PENNY,SHELDON
3764,All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.,SHELDON,PENNY
3765,Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3766,"As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it.",SHELDON,RAJ

3768,"Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3769,"Uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.",PENNY,SHELDON
3770,Congratulations on a successful live show.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3771,I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3772,"Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.",SHELDON,PENNY
3773,She was listening through the door. She wants me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3774,I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3775,Call if there’s any problems.,OTHERS,PENNY
3776,I’m sorry?,LEONARD,PENNY
3777,"That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?",LEONARD,LEONARD
3778,His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3779,"Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.",LEONARD,PENNY
3780,"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.",SHELDON,OTHERS
3781,Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?,SHELDON,PENNY
3782,Can you start in the morning?,OTHERS,PENNY
3783,"I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.",SHELDON,PENNY
3784,"Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about.",SHELDON,PENNY
3785,"I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.",PENNY,SHELDON
3786,Just say you want to drive.,PENNY,SHELDON

3794,"We, we really appreciate it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3795,"Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?",OTHERS,SHELDON
3796,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
3797,It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3798,"No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.",LEONARD,HOWARD
3799,"You see right through me, don’t you?",SHELDON,LEONARD
3800,It’s right down the hall.,LEONARD,PENNY
3801,"No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.",PENNY,HOWARD
3802,"Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.",RAJ,SHELDON
3803,What’s wrong?,PENNY,SHELDON
3804,What do you mean?,SHELDON,PENNY
3805,"Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.",PENNY,LEONARD
3806,"Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.",RAJ,SHELDON
3807,"Of course, we can split any profits three ways.",LEONARD,OTHERS
3808,Everyone’s a better mom than me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3809,So does that answer your question?,HOWARD,RAJ
3810,Thank you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3811,"Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…",SHELDON,PENNY
3812,You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3813,"I’m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.",OTHERS,OTHERS
3814,"Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…",OTHERS,RAJ
3815,"Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.",RAJ,SHELDON
3816,"Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3817,"No, Leonard, you should hear this.",OTHERS,SHELDON

3820,Is this your card?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3821,See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We’ll take it.,HOWARD,HOWARD
3822,"Oh, you poor baby.",PENNY,PENNY
3823,"Gee, uh…",LEONARD,OTHERS
3824,"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3825,I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.,LEONARD,LEONARD
3826,"No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.",OTHERS,SHELDON

3828,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3829,"Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake.",LEONARD,PENNY
3830,"I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.",RAJ,SHELDON
3831,"I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3832,"Leonard, don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him.",PENNY,SHELDON
3833,I know what was in your dad’s letter.,OTHERS,SHELDON
3834,"Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3835,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
3836,You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3837,Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?,LEONARD,LEONARD
3838,"No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?",PENNY,LEONARD
3839,"Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.",PENNY,SHELDON
3840,You are happy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
3841,"But half-man, half-owl could fly…",RAJ,LEONARD

3845,"Last week, you spent that on a little dress.",OTHERS,PENNY
3846,Call me if you need anything.,LEONARD,OTHERS
3847,"Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.",SHELDON,LEONARD
3848,"Fine. Look, I’ll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way.",HOWARD,OTHERS
3849,"Yeah, why not?",PENNY,LEONARD
3850,"Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
3851,You are?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3852,Yes?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3853,I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3854,I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?,SHELDON,LEONARD
3855,"Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?",SHELDON,PENNY
3856,"Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3857,Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.,PENNY,PENNY
3858,Thank you. That means a lot to me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3859,"See, she knew what always meant.",LEONARD,PENNY
3860,"Hey, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON

3862,"Oh. Howie, I had no idea.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3863,I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3864,Okay. So what’s up?,HOWARD,LEONARD
3865,So what do you want to do tonight?,OTHERS,PENNY
3866,I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.,OTHERS,PENNY
3867,I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.,OTHERS,LEONARD
3868,"No, that’s my potty training journal.",SHELDON,PENNY
3869,A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.,SHELDON,OTHERS

3891,"Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.",PENNY,LEONARD

3905,I think I’ll keep it for myself.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3906,"You mean, not a scientist?",OTHERS,RAJ
3907,Hi.,SHELDON,HOWARD
3908,"I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3909,I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.,HOWARD,PENNY

3912,"I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3913,You don’t.,LEONARD,PENNY
3914,"I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.",OTHERS,HOWARD
3915,Until you have kids.,LEONARD,RAJ

3929,There’s gotta be something else we could try.,LEONARD,PENNY
3930,"Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?",OTHERS,LEONARD
3931,I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.,LEONARD,SHELDON

3933,"Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.",PENNY,LEONARD
3934,Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.,SHELDON,SHELDON
3935,"Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?",OTHERS,LEONARD
3936,The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.,LEONARD,SHELDON

3938,"Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3939,"Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?",LEONARD,SHELDON
3940,No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.,HOWARD,LEONARD
3941,Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.,RAJ,OTHERS
3942,"Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I’m sober.",HOWARD,OTHERS
3943,"Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?",PENNY,RAJ
3944,"And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.",SHELDON,LEONARD

3950,I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?,SHELDON,RAJ
3951,"All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in Sheldon Square.",RAJ,PENNY
3952,It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3953,"Yeah, me, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
3954,Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman’s office was?,OTHERS,SHELDON
3955,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.",SHELDON,HOWARD
3956,"Oh great, see you at seven.",SHELDON,PENNY
3957,"Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3958,"Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.",SHELDON,PENNY
3959,"Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother.",HOWARD,LEONARD
3960,"This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.",SHELDON,PENNY
3961,"Maybe since you’re so good, he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…",LEONARD,PENNY
3962,Really?,OTHERS,LEONARD
3963,What is wrong with you?,RAJ,LEONARD

3981,"See you, buddy.",HOWARD,PENNY
3982,"Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?",RAJ,OTHERS
3983,"I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?",HOWARD,LEONARD
3984,"Yeah, that’s why I did it.",HOWARD,OTHERS

3989,What are you talking about?,LEONARD,PENNY
3990,"If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.",SHELDON,SHELDON
3991,"It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
3992,This is the level you’re stooping to.,SHELDON,LEONARD
3993,"Good, good.",LEONARD,SHELDON
3994,That’ll teach her to care about your health.,LEONARD,SHELDON
3995,Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?,SHELDON,PENNY
3996,Happy Valentine’s Day.,PENNY,PENNY
3997,Well what?,PENNY,SHELDON

3999,"Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.",OTHERS,LEONARD

4004,This is actually gonna happen.,LEONARD,SHELDON

4006,But what about the other girl?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4007,"Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4008,Happy Thanks… Yikes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4009,"Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.",SHELDON,PENNY
4010,"Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.",SHELDON,PENNY
4011,"No, that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4012,"Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.",SHELDON,OTHERS
4013,That’s because it’s simple.,SHELDON,HOWARD
4014,"Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4015,I told you about him.,PENNY,SHELDON
4016,"Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.",SHELDON,SHELDON

4020,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.",HOWARD,PENNY
4021,"Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?",RAJ,SHELDON
4022,"Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them.",PENNY,LEONARD
4023,Uh-huh.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4024,"Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.",PENNY,PENNY
4025,"Okay, you’re right, I got myself into this, but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.",RAJ,PENNY
4026,"Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.",SHELDON,PENNY
4027,"Sheldon, it’s not that bad.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4028,"Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4029,"Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.",PENNY,SHELDON
4030,Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4031,Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4032,"I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.",PENNY,RAJ
4033,"Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies.",RAJ,RAJ
4034,"Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?",OTHERS,SHELDON
4035,"Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?",PENNY,LEONARD
4036,"So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.",RAJ,SHELDON
4037,"Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.",SHELDON,RAJ
4038,"Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.",PENNY,LEONARD
4039,You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4040,Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?,SHELDON,OTHERS
4041,"How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!",SHELDON,LEONARD
4042,"I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4043,"No, of course not.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4044,Don’t bother.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4045,"No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.",PENNY,SHELDON

4050,"Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4051,It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4052,I’m her husband.,LEONARD,PENNY
4053,Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4054,Sounds like everyone’s staying home. What do you say?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4055,"Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…",OTHERS,LEONARD
4056,"You can do it, Sheldon.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4057,"Oh I don’t know, 50, 55.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4058,"Oh, hey buddy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4059,"Oh, come on!",LEONARD,LEONARD
4060,"To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.",HOWARD,PENNY
4061,"Okay, I’m a little confused here.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4062,Could happen.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4063,You’re jogging.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4064,I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4065,"I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4066,"Oh, you’re where that bill goes.",RAJ,PENNY
4067,I don’t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4068,"Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4069,I’m sorry. I was just trying to help.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4070,It’s Leonard.,LEONARD,SHELDON

4073,"Just pretty good, I’d think you were doing very good.",PENNY,HOWARD
4074,"All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4075,"Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge.",RAJ,SHELDON
4076,Who would use our hot tub?,OTHERS,HOWARD
4077,Let’s keep thinking.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4078,"That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4079,How?,PENNY,LEONARD
4080,"Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4081,"Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4082,"Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…",SHELDON,PENNY
4083,We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.,RAJ,LEONARD
4084,I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4085,He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.,RAJ,OTHERS
4086,"Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4087,Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.,OTHERS,PENNY

4090,What are you waiting for?,PENNY,SHELDON
4091,Okay.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4092,"Yeah, sorry about that.",PENNY,LEONARD
4093,"Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?",SHELDON,RAJ
4094,"Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4095,"Yeah, why not? You can’t do any worse than Leonard.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4096,What else would it be?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4097,"No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4098,I thought you already read it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4099,"No, never mind, alright, go.",LEONARD,RAJ
4100,"Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4101,"Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don’t you just meet this girl and, see what happens.",PENNY,SHELDON
4102,"Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!",HOWARD,LEONARD
4103,What are you doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4104,They’ve got a phone.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4105,"Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?",RAJ,LEONARD
4106,"You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4107,So don’t watch TV. Read a book.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4108,Can’t this wait?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4109,Come in.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4110,I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!,LEONARD,SHELDON
4111,Sheldon? Sheldon?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4112,"Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4113,You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.,SHELDON,SHELDON

4123,"Sheldon, this is a summons.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4124,And how single are you right now?,HOWARD,OTHERS
4125,"Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4126,"Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.",SHELDON,OTHERS
4127,"Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4128,"You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.",SHELDON,PENNY
4129,How’d that go?,OTHERS,HOWARD

4131,"She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?",SHELDON,PENNY

4136,To be cool? Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
4137,"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4138,I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.,SHELDON,SHELDON

4150,These here parts?,RAJ,LEONARD
4151,How about the toaster oven?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4152,"Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4153,"Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.",LEONARD,OTHERS

4433,"Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn’t he?",OTHERS,HOWARD
4434,"Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.",RAJ,SHELDON
4435,Did he just somehow give me the finger?,PENNY,LEONARD
4436,Not with money. Read.,PENNY,LEONARD
4437,Fifteen seconds.,RAJ,OTHERS
4438,"You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.",LEONARD,PENNY
4439,Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4440,Not really.,RAJ,SHELDON
4441,What’s next?,OTHERS,SHELDON
4442,"I don’t know, it was just there.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4443,Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?,HOWARD,RAJ
4444,"Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.",OTHERS,PENNY
4445,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4446,Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?,SHELDON,RAJ
4447,A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4448,"Well, here’s your key back.",RAJ,LEONARD
4449,"Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone.",OTHERS,PENNY
4450,"There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4451,"No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4452,"Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4453,Right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4454,"Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?",HOWARD,SHELDON
4455,It’s my official NASA portrait.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4456,"How can I call her, you know I can’t talk to women.",RAJ,RAJ
4457,Really?,RAJ,HOWARD
4458,"Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.",OTHERS,OTHERS
4459,In a minute.,SHELDON,RAJ
4460,"Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.",PENNY,SHELDON
4461,"Penny, I said right hand red.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4462,"Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?",OTHERS,HOWARD
4463,"I’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?",LEONARD,OTHERS
4464,"Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?",PENNY,OTHERS
4465,"Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like.",PENNY,LEONARD
4466,"And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s Venus.",RAJ,SHELDON
4467,"Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.",SHELDON,PENNY
4468,"No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.",SHELDON,OTHERS
4469,I don’t know.,RAJ,LEONARD
4470,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
4471,"Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?",PENNY,RAJ
4472,"What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4473,"Oh, Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4474,"It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.",RAJ,SHELDON
4475,"I don’t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?",LEONARD,RAJ
4476,"Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!",LEONARD,PENNY
4477,"Uh, okay.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4478,Good for you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4479,Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?,OTHERS,HOWARD
4480,"Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.",RAJ,SHELDON
4481,Leonard?,SHELDON,RAJ
4482,"The, the gas station across the street.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4483,Aw.,LEONARD,PENNY
4484,Oh!,PENNY,SHELDON
4485,"A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.",OTHERS,HOWARD
4486,"Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4487,"It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4488,"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4489,Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?,SHELDON,LEONARD
4490,"No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.",LEONARD,HOWARD
4491,"Wait, that’s it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4492,"What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4493,I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4494,"No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.",RAJ,SHELDON
4495,I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.,SHELDON,PENNY
4496,"Rainbow, not chocolate.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4497,Yeah!,PENNY,SHELDON
4498,"Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4499,"Please, please, please don’t give up on her.",OTHERS,PENNY
4500,I like to boogie.,RAJ,OTHERS

4502,"Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking.",OTHERS,PENNY
4503,"Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car.",PENNY,PENNY
4504,Stipulated.,HOWARD,HOWARD
4505,"Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you.",PENNY,LEONARD
4506,Penny?,SHELDON,LEONARD
4507,"Don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?",OTHERS,LEONARD
4508,"Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.",RAJ,LEONARD
4509,"It’s just a theory. Uh, it’s not even worked out.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4510,"Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4511,"That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.",HOWARD,RAJ
4512,I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?,HOWARD,LEONARD
4513,"Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4514,Sure.,RAJ,LEONARD
4515,It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4516,What are we drinking now?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4517,That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4518,I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.,PENNY,PENNY
4519,Why shouldn’t I do it?,HOWARD,SHELDON
4520,"Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?",OTHERS,SHELDON
4521,Yeah.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4522,Then maybe you should spank me harder.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4523,"Just one second. Help, Cinnamon’s loose in the building.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4524,"Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.",PENNY,PENNY
4525,That’ll be all. That was fun.,LEONARD,PENNY
4526,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!,LEONARD,PENNY
4527,It’s to help reopen the comic book store.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4528,Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4529,Hey.,RAJ,SHELDON
4530,"Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4531,We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.,HOWARD,LEONARD

4536,"Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.",PENNY,OTHERS
4537,Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4538,It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4539,"57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.",LEONARD,PENNY
4540,"You mean, like a sweater?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4541,"One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4542,"Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4543,"Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.",RAJ,HOWARD
4544,"You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4545,"Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.",PENNY,LEONARD
4546,"Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?",SHELDON,RAJ
4547,"No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.",HOWARD,PENNY
4548,"Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4549,Leonard is wrong.,PENNY,SHELDON
4550,What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?,RAJ,PENNY
4551,"Oh boy, I was afraid of this.",RAJ,LEONARD
4552,I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.,PENNY,OTHERS

4554,Hello.,SHELDON,PENNY
4555,"Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4556,"Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”",HOWARD,SHELDON
4557,I have a DVD of that lecture.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4558,"Oh, snap.",RAJ,LEONARD
4559,"Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don’t know where you are dude, but it’s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh…  Oh look, there’s a girl taking her shirt off.",RAJ,LEONARD
4560,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4561,What just happened?,RAJ,LEONARD

4564,I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4565,And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4566,The math is all there. It’s not real.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4567,"If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4568,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
4569,I can’t see him.,RAJ,HOWARD

4573,Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.,OTHERS,LEONARD

4575,Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?,PENNY,LEONARD
4576,Really.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4577,You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4578,"No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?",SHELDON,SHELDON
4579,"So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?",OTHERS,LEONARD
4580,"Oh, Howard, stop.",RAJ,SHELDON
4581,"Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.",RAJ,LEONARD

4586,I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.,SHELDON,OTHERS

4591,"Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4592,No.,PENNY,RAJ
4593,Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.,OTHERS,LEONARD

4598,Down here.,OTHERS,PENNY
4599,You really figured it out?,HOWARD,HOWARD
4600,"Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.",SHELDON,OTHERS
4601,Do whatever you want.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4602,We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.,LEONARD,SHELDON

4604,"All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4605,That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4606,Yes and yes.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4607,"I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?",RAJ,SHELDON
4608,It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?,HOWARD,PENNY

4614,Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?,SHELDON,LEONARD
4615,So how were your holidays?,RAJ,OTHERS

4617,Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4618,"Here, you can have your seat.",RAJ,LEONARD
4619,Hulk sad.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4620,"No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.",PENNY,RAJ
4621,Sheldon!,OTHERS,LEONARD
4622,"Oh, well, nice to meet you.",RAJ,OTHERS

4624,"So, do you want to come?",PENNY,LEONARD
4625,Want some more wine?,LEONARD,PENNY
4626,"All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?",PENNY,LEONARD
4627,"They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4628,There goes our big payday.,LEONARD,SHELDON

4636,"Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?",SHELDON,LEONARD
4637,Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4638,Then what do we do?,PENNY,SHELDON
4639,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!",HOWARD,LEONARD

4658,She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4659,Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.,HOWARD,SHELDON

4661,Will you please sto…,HOWARD,RAJ
4662,"You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.",LEONARD,PENNY

4664,"Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4665,Really?,HOWARD,SHELDON
4666,"Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?",LEONARD,SHELDON
4667,"Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4668,On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!,HOWARD,LEONARD
4669,"That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!",SHELDON,RAJ
4670,I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.,RAJ,LEONARD

4676,"Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4677,"Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.",RAJ,LEONARD
4678,A little in college. You?,OTHERS,SHELDON

4692,"Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money.",OTHERS,OTHERS
4693,What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4694,Good for you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4695,Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.,LEONARD,LEONARD

4699,"Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.",SHELDON,SHELDON

4714,"Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4715,"I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out.",SHELDON,LEONARD

4720,"Oh, my God, the George Smoot?",PENNY,HOWARD
4721,"Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4722,For what?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4723,Way off.,PENNY,LEONARD
4724,Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4725,"You mean, like in bed or in the shower?",LEONARD,OTHERS
4726,"True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.",SHELDON,PENNY
4727,Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.,PENNY,LEONARD
4728,"Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.",LEONARD,PENNY
4729,I don’t drink.,SHELDON,PENNY
4730,"Uh, go ahead. Read it.",RAJ,HOWARD
4731,Any other questions?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4732,It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.,RAJ,LEONARD
4733,"Doesn’t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I’m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.",HOWARD,LEONARD

4739,What are you gonna do?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4740,I don’t own a pocket watch.,HOWARD,SHELDON

4743,"Sheldon, come on back.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4744,"Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4745,You’re welcome.,PENNY,LEONARD
4746,I don’t put pepper on salads.,RAJ,SHELDON
4747,"Oh, thank goodness.",SHELDON,PENNY
4748,The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.,OTHERS,HOWARD
4749,Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4750,"Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4751,"Oh, yeah.",HOWARD,RAJ
4752,No. That’s not what he meant.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4753,"Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?",SHELDON,RAJ
4754,And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.,PENNY,SHELDON
4755,It’s Stephen Hawking.,SHELDON,HOWARD
4756,"You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all.",SHELDON,PENNY
4757,And?,HOWARD,SHELDON
4758,"No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?",LEONARD,HOWARD
4759,"She saw that, huh?",HOWARD,HOWARD
4760,"Sheldon, are you hungry?",OTHERS,SHELDON

4763,Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?,SHELDON,OTHERS
4764,Yup. Got the code.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4765,"That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?",HOWARD,PENNY
4766,"All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun.",SHELDON,PENNY
4767,"Sheldon, I don’t think this actually means…",LEONARD,LEONARD
4768,"Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4769,Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.,LEONARD,LEONARD

4773,I have business in Los Angeles.,OTHERS,PENNY
4774,She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.,PENNY,LEONARD
4775,"Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?",PENNY,LEONARD
4776,"By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?",RAJ,LEONARD
4777,"No, but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.",LEONARD,HOWARD
4778,And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.,SHELDON,OTHERS

4787,"You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?",RAJ,SHELDON
4788,The ladies?,LEONARD,PENNY
4789,"That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.",HOWARD,HOWARD
4790,Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.,RAJ,LEONARD
4791,"Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4792,I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.,OTHERS,LEONARD
4793,Shrewd.,SHELDON,PENNY
4794,Can you believe this guy?,SHELDON,OTHERS
4795,That is so beautiful.,RAJ,LEONARD
4796,I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.,SHELDON,PENNY
4797,"Thank you. No bendy straw, some party.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4798,"Maybe, if she asks.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4799,"Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4800,I think you should turn on the GPS.,SHELDON,PENNY
4801,"Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4802,"All right, what about music?",PENNY,LEONARD
4803,"Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess.",SHELDON,LEONARD
4804,Why?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4805,"Not really, no.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4806,"Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time.",OTHERS,PENNY

4813,I understand.,PENNY,SHELDON
4814,"Yeah, that’s basically what I said.",PENNY,SHELDON
4815,"All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.",SHELDON,PENNY
4816,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.,LEONARD,SHELDON
4817,"Little misunderstanding, huh.",PENNY,LEONARD
4818,His feelings needed to be hurt.,PENNY,LEONARD
4819,"That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.",OTHERS,PENNY
4820,You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.,SHELDON,SHELDON
4821,"For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you.",RAJ,LEONARD

4826,"Oh, that’s nice.",PENNY,PENNY
4827,I’d like to do the math.,SHELDON,PENNY
4828,"Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?",PENNY,LEONARD
4829,"Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.",RAJ,LEONARD
4830,"Well, I think tonight was a very good start.",LEONARD,LEONARD

4834,What do you mean!?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4835,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
4836,Is he okay?,PENNY,SHELDON
4837,"Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4838,"Janine the Machine, wet’s do this!",OTHERS,LEONARD

4841,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
4842,Seedy underbelly?,LEONARD,HOWARD
4843,It’s open.,PENNY,PENNY
4844,"Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4845,Because this company needs you.,PENNY,HOWARD
4846,I think we’d make amazing parents.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4847,"Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you.",LEONARD,RAJ
4848,"Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.",RAJ,LEONARD
4849,"Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up.",PENNY,LEONARD

4855,They have beach right in the name. What do you think?,SHELDON,SHELDON
4856,"Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?",HOWARD,HOWARD
4857,"What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power.",SHELDON,PENNY
4858,"I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
4859,"Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.",RAJ,PENNY
4860,"Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…",PENNY,SHELDON
4861,Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?,SHELDON,HOWARD
4862,I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.,HOWARD,LEONARD
4863,What if we brought them down with us?,RAJ,SHELDON
4864,"Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.",SHELDON,PENNY
4865,"Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?",PENNY,SHELDON
4866,Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!,LEONARD,PENNY
4867,Can you please just help me?,HOWARD,RAJ
4868,"No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.",LEONARD,LEONARD

4887,"Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.",RAJ,LEONARD
4888,Can you focus on what we’re talking about?,LEONARD,PENNY
4889,Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!,HOWARD,LEONARD
4890,What do you want?,LEONARD,LEONARD

4892,"Let me guess, motion sensors?",LEONARD,LEONARD
4893,I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.,SHELDON,OTHERS
4894,"What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4895,"Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard.",OTHERS,LEONARD
4896,No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.,LEONARD,HOWARD
4897,Why would I be upset?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4898,It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.,OTHERS,SHELDON
4899,I really should have brought my own car.,PENNY,SHELDON
4900,He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4901,Ah!,LEONARD,RAJ
4902,"I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4903,"That’s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened.",OTHERS,SHELDON
4904,"I really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there’s just no pleasing you.",SHELDON,SHELDON

4907,"Really, why?",PENNY,PENNY
4908,It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.,SHELDON,LEONARD
4909,"Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4910,"Oh, wow.",LEONARD,LEONARD
4911,"If you’re that upset, go get her back.",LEONARD,SHELDON
4912,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!,RAJ,PENNY
4913,Can we get autographed dolls?,LEONARD,SHELDON
4914,"Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.",PENNY,SHELDON
4915,I don’t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.,HOWARD,SHELDON
4916,Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?,HOWARD,PENNY
4917,"Hey, where you been?",LEONARD,SHELDON
4918,Okay.,HOWARD,RAJ

4924,Wow.,PENNY,LEONARD
4925,What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4926,"It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.",SHELDON,PENNY
4927,Great.,PENNY,SHELDON
4928,"Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You’d be the only doable girl.",HOWARD,LEONARD
4929,They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.,OTHERS,RAJ
4930,"No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.",OTHERS,PENNY
4931,So why are you trying to ruin it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4932,What kind of needs?,RAJ,OTHERS
4933,Thank you.,RAJ,SHELDON

4941,"Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety.",HOWARD,SHELDON
4942,Great.,PENNY,HOWARD
4943,Then what does tweepadock mean?,OTHERS,LEONARD
4944,I’m pretty sure it’s already over.,LEONARD,SHELDON

4947,No.,HOWARD,RAJ
4948,He’s really cute. How do you know him?,OTHERS,RAJ

4951,What are you doing?,LEONARD,HOWARD
4952,The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.,SHELDON,SHELDON

4960,Then I graciously accept.,OTHERS,PENNY
4961,"Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.",SHELDON,OTHERS
4962,You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.,LEONARD,LEONARD
4963,"Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
4964,You okay?,LEONARD,LEONARD
4965,That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.,SHELDON,PENNY
4966,"So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?",SHELDON,SHELDON

4971,"Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting.",HOWARD,SHELDON

4973,"I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me.",RAJ,SHELDON
4974,My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.,SHELDON,LEONARD

4976,Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?,PENNY,LEONARD
4977,"Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.",LEONARD,SHELDON

4981,PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.,OTHERS,LEONARD

5536,"Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5537,I don’t know what to say.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5538,Hey.,HOWARD,PENNY

5542,What? Why?,LEONARD,LEONARD
5543,I love you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5544,"Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?",OTHERS,OTHERS
5545,"No, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. I will.",PENNY,LEONARD
5546,"My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5547,"Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.",RAJ,RAJ
5548,"No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.",SHELDON,PENNY
5549,"But technically, yes.",RAJ,SHELDON
5550,I’ll see if it’s available.,PENNY,PENNY
5551,"All right, you have a wager.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5552,"Oh, okay. Thank you.",OTHERS,PENNY
5553,I don’t know. How do you want to start?,RAJ,SHELDON
5554,Pull up your pants.,PENNY,SHELDON
5555,This is so exciting.,OTHERS,PENNY
5556,"But, now, but in my defence…",SHELDON,RAJ
5557,"Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?",SHELDON,PENNY
5558,Seriously? Airborne worms?,SHELDON,PENNY
5559,"Well, it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5560,How’d you get that?,HOWARD,SHELDON
5561,"Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.",RAJ,HOWARD
5562,You knocked more than usual.,PENNY,LEONARD
5563,How’s it going out there?,OTHERS,LEONARD
5564,"Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?",SHELDON,RAJ
5565,"Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5566,W-Where are you going?,SHELDON,PENNY
5567,What are you doing?,PENNY,SHELDON
5568,"Well, most recently my gynaecologist.",OTHERS,SHELDON

5570,She’s been here before.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5571,I mean without lying.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5572,For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.,SHELDON,RAJ
5573,"Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already.",PENNY,LEONARD
5574,"Will they, Leonard?",SHELDON,RAJ
5575,"Okay, just the candle thing.",RAJ,LEONARD
5576,"Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5577,It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.,RAJ,LEONARD
5578,"Well, sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.",PENNY,PENNY
5579,"Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?",PENNY,SHELDON
5580,Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5581,"Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?",OTHERS,SHELDON
5582,Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5583,You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5584,What’s wrong?,PENNY,LEONARD

5590,You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.,SHELDON,HOWARD
5591,Can I tell you a secret?,PENNY,SHELDON
5592,Hmm.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5593,Unbelievable.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5594,"There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.",SHELDON,OTHERS
5595,"Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.",SHELDON,PENNY
5596,"Howard, why is he yelling at me?",OTHERS,SHELDON
5597,"If you don’t know how to make lasagna, Google does.",OTHERS,LEONARD
5598,I’m with you. I just have to make sure if I’m a synthetic human I’d still be Jewish. I promised my mother.,HOWARD,PENNY
5599,Yeah.,OTHERS,OTHERS
5600,"Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?",PENNY,SHELDON
5601,They’re out shopping right now?,OTHERS,PENNY
5602,Sheldon?,OTHERS,LEONARD
5603,"Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5604,"Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5605,All right. All systems go. In five…,HOWARD,HOWARD
5606,"You know, there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman.",RAJ,LEONARD
5607,"Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?",OTHERS,SHELDON
5608,"I’m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!",HOWARD,SHELDON
5609,"So, I put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.",OTHERS,OTHERS
5610,"Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.",OTHERS,RAJ
5611,I’m kind of getting into the groove here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5612,She’s right.,HOWARD,RAJ
5613,"Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?",OTHERS,PENNY
5614,"Well, I understand, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5615,That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5616,"No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.",RAJ,SHELDON
5617,I can’t believe they let him into Canada.,RAJ,SHELDON
5618,"Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5619,"Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5620,"Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs.",PENNY,SHELDON
5621,"No, you didn’t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5622,"Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.",LEONARD,HOWARD
5623,"Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5624,"Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon",LEONARD,LEONARD
5625,It’s sad how great that sounds.,HOWARD,SHELDON
5626,Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5627,I never kid about safety.,SHELDON,RAJ
5628,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
5629,"Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.",LEONARD,SHELDON

5631,Can you give us a minute?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5632,My turn.,RAJ,HOWARD
5633,Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?,OTHERS,RAJ
5634,No problem.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5635,"No, really. I have a girlfriend now.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5636,You mean the myofascial point?,SHELDON,SHELDON
5637,"Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5638,"Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?",SHELDON,LEONARD
5639,"She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5640,Now we’re getting somewhere.,LEONARD,SHELDON
5641,"Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
5642,"Oh, hi.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5643,Why do I even try?,OTHERS,PENNY
5644,Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?,OTHERS,SHELDON
5645,You’re being impossible.,SHELDON,SHELDON
5646,"Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.",PENNY,LEONARD
5647,"Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?",PENNY,LEONARD
5648,I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.,SHELDON,OTHERS
5649,"Hey, I gave you first crack at it.",HOWARD,PENNY
5650,I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5651,Sure.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5652,Let me finish. It’s like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don’t want in a man.,OTHERS,PENNY

5658,"Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5659,Excellent. Go on.,SHELDON,SHELDON

5661,"Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.",PENNY,PENNY
5662,Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?,PENNY,LEONARD
5663,She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5664,"She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.",RAJ,PENNY
5665,"Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?",LEONARD,SHELDON
5666,"I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.",SHELDON,HOWARD
5667,Wonder why she didn’t tell me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
5668,"Yeah, come on, Raj.",PENNY,SHELDON
5669,I thought your dad paid your cards.,HOWARD,SHELDON
5670,"Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.",SHELDON,PENNY
5671,"Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?",LEONARD,RAJ
5672,"Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.",PENNY,OTHERS
5673,"No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.",PENNY,LEONARD
5674,"Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.",SHELDON,RAJ
5675,Even though your dress is ugly.,PENNY,LEONARD
5676,"Oh, Sheldon!",PENNY,RAJ
5677,"When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5678,"Leonard, wait.",HOWARD,HOWARD
5679,"So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.",RAJ,PENNY

5686,"I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?",SHELDON,RAJ
5687,"Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.",SHELDON,OTHERS

5693,Before; now it’s you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5694,I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?,RAJ,HOWARD
5695,"Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.",SHELDON,SHELDON
5696,I want a real apology.,OTHERS,OTHERS
5697,"Me, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5698,How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?,LEONARD,SHELDON
5699,Dr Gablehouser.,RAJ,SHELDON
5700,Because you were driving like a lunatic.,OTHERS,LEONARD
5701,"Or, as we call them, Shamy.",HOWARD,PENNY
5702,"Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.",LEONARD,SHELDON
5703,"You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.",SHELDON,LEONARD
5704,"What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.",SHELDON,PENNY
5705,"You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?",OTHERS,PENNY
5706,"No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.",RAJ,SHELDON
5707,"I don’t know, hunting?",HOWARD,HOWARD
5708,Okay.,HOWARD,PENNY
5709,"Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem.",RAJ,PENNY
5710,"Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.",PENNY,SHELDON
5711,"Hello? Another medical emergency? What’s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5712,"Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.",HOWARD,SHELDON
5713,"Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?",PENNY,SHELDON
5714,"Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person.",RAJ,LEONARD
5715,"Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.",OTHERS,HOWARD
5716,He’s not dying.,PENNY,LEONARD
5717,"So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?",PENNY,SHELDON
5718,Thank you.,LEONARD,RAJ

5725,"Come on, Sheldon!",RAJ,SHELDON

5738,I’ll tell you why.,SHELDON,HOWARD
5739,Are you getting sick?,PENNY,PENNY
5740,I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.,SHELDON,LEONARD
5741,"Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?",PENNY,LEONARD
5742,"Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5743,"Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.",PENNY,SHELDON
5744,"When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.",SHELDON,PENNY
5745,Yeah.,OTHERS,SHELDON
5746,We do seem to keep finding room mates.,LEONARD,PENNY
5747,I’m Batman. Shhhhh!,SHELDON,LEONARD

5749,Everything okay?,RAJ,PENNY
5750,"I’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5751,How can I convince you it won’t?,HOWARD,SHELDON
5752,"Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.",RAJ,SHELDON
5753,"You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.",OTHERS,SHELDON
5754,"Leonard, you’ve got one on your tail.",HOWARD,SHELDON

6094,Ooh!,OTHERS,SHELDON
6095,Why? It clearly doesn’t work.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6096,"This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.",SHELDON,PENNY

6230,"Well, it’s got to be one or the other, which is it?",PENNY,HOWARD

6391,"Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!",LEONARD,PENNY
6392,"Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6393,Any particular reason why?,PENNY,PENNY
6394,Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6395,"He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6396,"You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.",PENNY,LEONARD
6397,"Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6398,"You know, I will miss this.",PENNY,SHELDON
6399,"Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.",RAJ,SHELDON
6400,"Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?",SHELDON,RAJ
6401,"No, she’s real.",LEONARD,SHELDON

6403,Sure.,LEONARD,HOWARD

6405,So?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6406,I remember him.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6407,Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?,HOWARD,PENNY
6408,You have my blessing. Go for it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6409,Would you like to talk about it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6410,"No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.",RAJ,SHELDON
6411,"Well, so how does it work?",PENNY,SHELDON

6415,You did everything you could.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6416,Don’t say that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6417,Just a few.,SHELDON,PENNY
6418,So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?,RAJ,SHELDON
6419,I don’t really want to.,PENNY,SHELDON
6420,"She’s sick, I knew it. Bye.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6421,"Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.",PENNY,SHELDON
6422,Hello.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6423,That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6424,"No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.",PENNY,SHELDON
6425,"Leonard, are you asleep?",PENNY,SHELDON

6432,Is that Bert?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6433,One ladder left.,RAJ,SHELDON
6434,"Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6435,I’m going to count to three. One…,OTHERS,SHELDON
6436,Yeah?,OTHERS,SHELDON
6437,"You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.",SHELDON,RAJ
6438,Four months.,LEONARD,PENNY
6439,You use it to get your way.,OTHERS,HOWARD
6440,Thank you.,PENNY,LEONARD
6441,Maybe we should give them some privacy.,LEONARD,PENNY
6442,"Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.",PENNY,RAJ
6443,"I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6444,You were right.,OTHERS,PENNY
6445,It’s heebie-jeebies.,HOWARD,SHELDON

6451,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6452,"Sheldon, wake up.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6453,"I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6454,So?,HOWARD,LEONARD
6455,"Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.",PENNY,SHELDON
6456,You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?,OTHERS,HOWARD
6457,"Thank you, officer.",LEONARD,HOWARD
6458,"Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6459,Doesn’t that violate the health code?,LEONARD,PENNY
6460,Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6461,We stand up.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6462,I’ve got a solution.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6463,"Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.",PENNY,OTHERS
6464,The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?,HOWARD,SHELDON
6465,Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6466,"Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?",PENNY,LEONARD

6470,"Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6471,"She’s pretty good, huh?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6472,"Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…",PENNY,LEONARD
6473,Just be honest. You don’t like it.,RAJ,LEONARD
6474,"Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6475,This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?,PENNY,SHELDON
6476,"Damn you, walletnook.com.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6477,"Oh, of course, come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6478,"Thank you, but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year.",RAJ,RAJ
6479,"Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6480,"That’s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6481,Leonard…,PENNY,PENNY
6482,So what do you need the headphones for?,PENNY,OTHERS
6483,"Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.",PENNY,LEONARD
6484,Yeah. It’s all very professional.,PENNY,SHELDON
6485,"Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6486,"I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6487,You want to talk?,PENNY,LEONARD
6488,"Well, it’s not like I’m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6489,You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6490,"Oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between.",RAJ,SHELDON
6491,I like it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6492,"I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn’t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6493,Guys.,LEONARD,PENNY
6494,"She’s a hooker, isn’t she.",HOWARD,HOWARD
6495,Weird.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6496,"I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6497,Bye.,PENNY,PENNY
6498,"No, you don’t understand.",HOWARD,OTHERS
6499,Hi.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6500,"It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6501,Me? Why me?,OTHERS,PENNY
6502,"So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?",RAJ,SHELDON
6503,How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?,SHELDON,PENNY
6504,"You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.",RAJ,SHELDON
6505,Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”,RAJ,RAJ
6506,"Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6507,"Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?",SHELDON,LEONARD
6508,"The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6509,"So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.",PENNY,SHELDON
6510,Your sweater?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6511,"No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6512,Is somebody working on that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6513,"No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6514,Has it really only been ten miles?,HOWARD,SHELDON
6515,Then I don’t know.,PENNY,RAJ
6516,What does that mean?,PENNY,SHELDON
6517,"Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6518,"Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?",SHELDON,PENNY
6519,No.,LEONARD,PENNY
6520,"No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6521,"Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…",SHELDON,SHELDON
6522,"Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?",RAJ,SHELDON
6523,I’m getting to it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6524,"Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules.",HOWARD,PENNY
6525,"Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream.",PENNY,PENNY
6526,"And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.",RAJ,SHELDON
6527,"Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6528,So why’d you ask?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6529,"Oh, next question.",PENNY,LEONARD
6530,It’s just this guy I used to date.,PENNY,LEONARD
6531,"It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?",OTHERS,HOWARD
6532,"Yeah, those are men who just had sex.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6533,Why are you shaking? Are you cold?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6534,You know I’m gonna read it either way.,PENNY,LEONARD
6535,"Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can’t afford it, Howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.",LEONARD,PENNY
6536,"Oh, my God, are you okay?",LEONARD,RAJ
6537,"I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6538,"Okay, we’re headed out, see you later.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6539,Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6540,You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6541,What’s wrong?,PENNY,HOWARD
6542,"Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.",SHELDON,PENNY
6543,"All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6544,"‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?",PENNY,SHELDON
6545,"Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6546,"Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6547,"What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?",PENNY,SHELDON
6548,"No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6549,"It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6550,"If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.",RAJ,OTHERS
6551,"Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one.",LEONARD,HOWARD
6552,Whoa! That’s heavy.,PENNY,PENNY
6553,I’m sleeping with your son.,PENNY,SHELDON
6554,"Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.",RAJ,PENNY
6555,"Don’t look up, there’s cameras.",LEONARD,PENNY
6556,"Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.",SHELDON,HOWARD
6557,Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?,OTHERS,RAJ
6558,"And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.",OTHERS,PENNY
6559,Hi.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6560,"Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6561,So you betrayed me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6562,"You can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint.",SHELDON,HOWARD
6563,Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.,SHELDON,RAJ
6564,"I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6565,"Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.",RAJ,LEONARD
6566,"Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6567,"All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?",PENNY,LEONARD
6568,I guess that’s all anybody wants.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6569,Yeah.,RAJ,PENNY
6570,"Leonard, do you understand this?",SHELDON,RAJ
6571,"This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or… or… wondering if you’re a dude down there.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6572,I guess this is it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6573,"Uh, can I help you?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6574,She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6575,So he goes back into rehab?,LEONARD,RAJ
6576,"Well, but where does he get the helium?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6577,"Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.",LEONARD,HOWARD
6578,"… but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….",RAJ,LEONARD
6579,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6580,"Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6581,I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.,SHELDON,PENNY
6582,"Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.",OTHERS,HOWARD
6583,So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.,PENNY,PENNY
6584,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6585,Chosen by science?,LEONARD,PENNY
6586,"No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.",RAJ,SHELDON
6587,"Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?",OTHERS,SHELDON
6588,I don’t understand.,RAJ,LEONARD
6589,"It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving, that’s it.",PENNY,LEONARD
6590,"Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level.",SHELDON,RAJ
6591,"Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?",LEONARD,SHELDON
6592,Does that help?,OTHERS,LEONARD
6593,"December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6594,I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.,SHELDON,HOWARD
6595,What was that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6596,No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.,OTHERS,PENNY
6597,"Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.",HOWARD,HOWARD
6598,"You know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6599,"Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6600,"Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6601,"Well, I’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6602,Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6603,"Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t Christie stay with me.",HOWARD,PENNY
6604,"Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.",LEONARD,OTHERS
6605,"That’s great, Leslie. Thanks.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6606,Thank you.,PENNY,LEONARD
6607,Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.,OTHERS,LEONARD
6608,"I said, what are you doing here?",SHELDON,RAJ
6609,"Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6610,"Yes. There, I said it.",LEONARD,RAJ
6611,"I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6612,Really good.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6613,Did you get my mail.,PENNY,HOWARD
6614,Penny.,LEONARD,PENNY
6615,"Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6616,"Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?",HOWARD,SHELDON
6617,"Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?",OTHERS,LEONARD
6618,Hi.,PENNY,PENNY
6619,Un-unravelable?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6620,"That’s great, Ma!",HOWARD,PENNY
6621,"Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6622,"Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.",OTHERS,OTHERS
6623,Why not.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6624,So if it breaks there’d be none of it?,PENNY,PENNY
6625,"Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?",HOWARD,HOWARD
6626,What are you doing here?,SHELDON,SHELDON
6627,"Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6628,It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6629,No.,OTHERS,PENNY
6630,"Well, what was the plan?",LEONARD,LEONARD
6631,"Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.",RAJ,RAJ

6633,"Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6634,We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.,RAJ,LEONARD
6635,Check.,HOWARD,LEONARD
6636,It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.,RAJ,SHELDON
6637,What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6638,"Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.",HOWARD,LEONARD
6639,"Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too.",SHELDON,OTHERS
6640,"Hello, Bert.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6641,Hey.,HOWARD,PENNY
6642,Sheldon.,HOWARD,PENNY
6643,"Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6644,"All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?",SHELDON,SHELDON
6645,"No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
6646,A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.,HOWARD,RAJ
6647,"Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!",RAJ,LEONARD
6648,"Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?",PENNY,SHELDON
6649,"Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?",HOWARD,PENNY
6650,"Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.",OTHERS,HOWARD
6651,Stick your head in there and find out.,HOWARD,HOWARD
6652,"I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.",RAJ,PENNY
6653,I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.,OTHERS,RAJ
6654,I didn’t steal anyone.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6655,"Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air.",LEONARD,HOWARD
6656,"Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6657,"Because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can I help?” and “I’m so proud of you.” Ugh!",PENNY,SHELDON

6935,"Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.",RAJ,LEONARD
6936,Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.,PENNY,SHELDON
6937,"Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.",RAJ,SHELDON
6938,Not a chance.,OTHERS,SHELDON
6939,"Oh, you are killing me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6940,"Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it to you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6941,"Uh, pretty much, why?",PENNY,LEONARD
6942,"Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…",PENNY,SHELDON
6943,And I told you to bite me.,OTHERS,HOWARD
6944,That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.,RAJ,LEONARD
6945,Her. We thought you two would hit it off.,HOWARD,SHELDON
6946,Is that Raj and Howard?,PENNY,PENNY
6947,"Oh, God.",PENNY,SHELDON
6948,I hope so.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6949,"This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6950,"Yeah, we totally did.",RAJ,SHELDON
6951,How does that happen?,OTHERS,SHELDON
6952,I guess not.,LEONARD,PENNY
6953,"Oh, shut up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6954,"Bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money.",PENNY,SHELDON
6955,No we don’t.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6956,"Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6957,"Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What’s troubling you, buddy?",PENNY,SHELDON
6958,"Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back.",SHELDON,HOWARD
6959,I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?,SHELDON,LEONARD
6960,"You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk",SHELDON,SHELDON
6961,See?,LEONARD,SHELDON
6962,"And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.",OTHERS,LEONARD
6963,I don’t think so.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6964,Unbelievable.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6965,Oh!,SHELDON,LEONARD
6966,Good. Your mom seems nice.,PENNY,SHELDON
6967,"Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict.",SHELDON,PENNY
6968,"Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you.",RAJ,SHELDON
6969,"With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.",OTHERS,SHELDON
6970,Bread.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6971,"No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past.  I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!",SHELDON,PENNY
6972,Of course I’m busy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6973,Good night.,LEONARD,LEONARD
6974,All right.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6975,"You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.",PENNY,PENNY
6976,He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.,SHELDON,SHELDON
6977,"Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.",LEONARD,SHELDON
6978,"No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.",SHELDON,LEONARD
6979,"Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head.",PENNY,LEONARD
6980,"I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions.",SHELDON,SHELDON
6981,What do you mean?,PENNY,HOWARD
6982,Looks good.,RAJ,HOWARD
6983,Great. Let’s do it.,HOWARD,PENNY
6984,Mm.,PENNY,SHELDON
6985,Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.,SHELDON,LEONARD
6986,She hit on me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
6987,Oopsy.,PENNY,SHELDON
6988,There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.,PENNY,LEONARD
6989,When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?,LEONARD,LEONARD
6990,"Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape.",SHELDON,OTHERS
6991,"So, hi. What’s up?",PENNY,HOWARD
6992,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
6993,"Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…",HOWARD,SHELDON
6994,"Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off.",PENNY,PENNY
6995,I think someone owes me an apology.,LEONARD,HOWARD
6996,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?,LEONARD,PENNY
6997,"Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?",SHELDON,OTHERS
6998,"Hey, Lesley.",LEONARD,LEONARD
6999,"Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7000,"Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7001,There’s no way.,SHELDON,PENNY
7002,"Oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning.",LEONARD,HOWARD
7003,"Again, no offence, but so have I.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7004,Leviticus 11:3: “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”,RAJ,SHELDON
7005,"I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.",RAJ,SHELDON
7006,You did?,OTHERS,PENNY
7007,Phones can do that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7008,Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?,PENNY,LEONARD
7009,"Oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale.",LEONARD,PENNY
7010,"You just said yourself, it’s sad.",PENNY,LEONARD
7011,"You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7012,You bet.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7013,Forget the robot. What happened to you?,LEONARD,HOWARD
7014,Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.,SHELDON,RAJ
7015,"Oh, that’s nice.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7016,"Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him.",PENNY,SHELDON
7017,"Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!",LEONARD,LEONARD
7018,The Archies are over here.,RAJ,LEONARD
7019,"The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7020,"Is, uh, is he dangerous?",OTHERS,HOWARD
7021,"Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat..",SHELDON,SHELDON
7022,"The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7023,"Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.",PENNY,SHELDON
7024,"Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?",OTHERS,SHELDON
7025,"Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?",PENNY,SHELDON
7026,Wow. When does that start?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7027,"Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7028,Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7029,Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.,LEONARD,PENNY
7030,"Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?",RAJ,SHELDON
7031,I thought you did.,HOWARD,HOWARD
7032,Is that true?,PENNY,RAJ
7033,"Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.",OTHERS,PENNY
7034,Hey.,RAJ,SHELDON
7035,"Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.",LEONARD,PENNY
7036,What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7037,But we didn’t see them bust one ghost.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7038,That’s not what I was going to tell you.,LEONARD,PENNY
7039,"‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody!  What was that about?",PENNY,SHELDON
7040,I know. I want to talk to you.,PENNY,LEONARD
7041,The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7042,It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7043,"Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7044,Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.,PENNY,PENNY
7045,"Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight.",HOWARD,PENNY
7046,"Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7047,"Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.",SHELDON,PENNY
7048,"Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.",PENNY,HOWARD
7049,"I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.",LEONARD,PENNY
7050,Good. Then you’re used to this.,OTHERS,PENNY
7051,"Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7052,Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.,SHELDON,PENNY
7053,Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7054,"I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.",SHELDON,OTHERS
7055,"Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.",PENNY,HOWARD
7056,"It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.",PENNY,RAJ
7057,"That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7058,"I’m single, I don’t need this crap.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7059,"Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.",PENNY,RAJ
7060,"Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time.",PENNY,HOWARD
7061,"Oh, my goodness.",RAJ,HOWARD
7062,"No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7063,"Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7064,Sorry.,PENNY,SHELDON
7065,"When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?",SHELDON,PENNY
7066,I suggest you go through with it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7067,"You can try, but you’ll never catch me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7068,It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.,RAJ,SHELDON
7069,Sheldon.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7070,A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7071,That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7072,"Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7073,"Shh, he said it’s interesting.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7074,"Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work.",LEONARD,PENNY
7075,Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7076,Wait for me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7077,"Listen, I need to talk to you about something.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7078,"Oh, you never were?",OTHERS,LEONARD
7079,See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7080,What?,LEONARD,OTHERS
7081,"That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?",SHELDON,PENNY
7082,"Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7083,"Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.",RAJ,LEONARD
7084,Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?,PENNY,LEONARD
7085,"What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7086,"Can it wait, I need to talk to you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7087,"Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.",SHELDON,PENNY
7088,"Yeah, sure, of course I love him.",PENNY,SHELDON
7089,"Oh, my God.",PENNY,SHELDON
7090,Not yet.,SHELDON,OTHERS
7091,Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.,RAJ,LEONARD
7092,"Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.",RAJ,SHELDON
7093,"Okay, I was just checking.",PENNY,HOWARD
7094,"Oh, right, right right right right.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7095,"Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7096,"Well, I don’t want your germs around me.",OTHERS,OTHERS
7097,What about my robot poster?,LEONARD,PENNY
7098,I stand corrected.,LEONARD,HOWARD
7099,Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7100,"Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.",OTHERS,RAJ
7101,"No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7102,"All right, I’ll give you that one.",SHELDON,RAJ
7103,They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.,HOWARD,HOWARD
7104,"Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7105,"Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?",LEONARD,PENNY
7106,"Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…",PENNY,HOWARD
7107,You’re just saying that.,RAJ,SHELDON
7108,"Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.",RAJ,HOWARD
7109,"Buddy, let it go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7110,"Well, I hope I get to see you again.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7111,"Oh, Howie.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7112,"We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.",PENNY,LEONARD
7113,"I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7114,Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7115,"Oh, that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?",PENNY,SHELDON
7116,"Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7117,Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.,SHELDON,PENNY
7118,"It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7119,"Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7120,"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup.",SHELDON,PENNY
7121,Yeah.,LEONARD,RAJ
7122,"Look, there’s something I need to tell you.",PENNY,LEONARD
7123,"Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7124,"Ah, you’re going off the grid.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7125,Beep.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7126,What is that?,OTHERS,RAJ
7127,What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!,HOWARD,PENNY
7128,"Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian.",SHELDON,RAJ
7129,"So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7130,Prevost’s theory of exchanges.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7131,"Darn. If you weren’t busy, I’d ask you to join us.",SHELDON,PENNY
7132,"Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7133,"Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7134,"You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move.",PENNY,PENNY
7135,How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?,PENNY,SHELDON
7136,Then why are you attacking us?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7137,"You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.",SHELDON,PENNY
7138,Maybe it’s wherever your pants are.,OTHERS,PENNY
7139,"Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.",PENNY,LEONARD
7140,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.,SHELDON,OTHERS
7141,"Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7142,"Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?",SHELDON,RAJ
7143,Challenge accepted.  We’re locked out.,SHELDON,PENNY
7144,Cheers.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7145,Spring wedding?,RAJ,SHELDON
7146,Fine.,LEONARD,OTHERS
7147,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7148,You hate Babylon 5.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7149,That was pretty cute.,HOWARD,OTHERS
7150,And there goes our hike.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7151,I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.,PENNY,LEONARD
7152,"I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.",RAJ,SHELDON
7153,"Hey, guys.",RAJ,SHELDON
7154,"I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.",PENNY,LEONARD
7155,Is there a window around here we don’t know about?,RAJ,PENNY
7156,Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?,HOWARD,RAJ
7157,"Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7158,"Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy.",HOWARD,HOWARD
7159,No. Maybe to her.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7160,"Kinda, sorta had to?",PENNY,LEONARD
7161,I guess.,PENNY,RAJ
7162,"True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7163,"Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t",LEONARD,SHELDON
7164,"Hey, Leslie.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7165,Nerds.,OTHERS,PENNY
7166,"In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7167,"Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7168,Forget about it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7169,None of your business. Take it or leave it.,RAJ,LEONARD
7170,I don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.,PENNY,SHELDON
7171,"No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7172,"Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7173,We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7174,"Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7175,I can’t believe she would say that about me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7176,"No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7177,I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7178,Yeah.,LEONARD,PENNY
7179,And people think I don’t get sarcasm.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7180,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.",SHELDON,PENNY
7181,"Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7182,"Ah, I also made oatmeal.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7183,Please. I’m desperate.,OTHERS,HOWARD
7184,"Nothing, you’re perfect.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7185,"She’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal.",PENNY,SHELDON
7186,"No, that’s okay. I’ll get it.",RAJ,SHELDON
7187,I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7188,Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.,SHELDON,PENNY
7189,Yep. Here’s some money.,LEONARD,PENNY
7190,It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7191,"Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.",SHELDON,PENNY
7192,Find something you like.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7193,"Okay, he cares about you a lot.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7194,"Stuart, please. You’re being rude.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7195,Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7196,"Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7197,"She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!",HOWARD,LEONARD
7198,Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7199,"A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.",OTHERS,HOWARD
7200,You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7201,"Oh, me neither, not until just now.",OTHERS,PENNY
7202,"No, I think it’s a firmware problem.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7203,You want to make plans for New Years.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7204,How you guys doing?,LEONARD,PENNY
7205,What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?,SHELDON,HOWARD
7206,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7207,They were out of scones.,SHELDON,PENNY
7208,Weawwy? Good to know.,OTHERS,OTHERS
7209,"Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7210,"No, no, no, I got it.",LEONARD,LEONARD

7218,"No, we just had a little spat.",LEONARD,RAJ
7219,He’s coming back from outer space.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7220,Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.,SHELDON,RAJ
7221,I’m sorry.,RAJ,HOWARD
7222,"Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7223,"I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven’t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.",PENNY,SHELDON
7224,"That’s it, I’m down to seven friends.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7225,You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?,LEONARD,PENNY
7226,No. All your little secrets are fine.,PENNY,OTHERS

7229,Actually.,RAJ,PENNY
7230,Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?,SHELDON,SHELDON

7243,Good boy. Here’s a cookie.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7244,That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7245,"Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7246,That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.,SHELDON,OTHERS

7259,Do you know what else I love about you?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7260,What do you do?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7261,"Counterpoint, no, it’s not.",LEONARD,LEONARD

7277,It is funny when you think about it.,RAJ,HOWARD
7278,Bought it at auction.,OTHERS,HOWARD
7279,Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.,OTHERS,PENNY
7280,"Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7281,"Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7282,This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7283,Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7284,But you don’t even know…,SHELDON,RAJ
7285,"Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best.",SHELDON,PENNY
7286,How you feeling?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7287,You got emotional when that lab monkey died.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7288,Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!,RAJ,SHELDON

7290,Then I guess congratulations are in order.,LEONARD,RAJ
7291,That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7292,Where are you going?,SHELDON,PENNY
7293,"No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.",SHELDON,SHELDON

7299,I think we’re there.,PENNY,LEONARD
7300,"So, where exactly are we in this relationship?",LEONARD,OTHERS
7301,Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.,RAJ,SHELDON

7306,You know very well how it went.,SHELDON,SHELDON

7316,"Yeah, well, then do it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7317,"So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”",OTHERS,SHELDON

7329,I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7330,"So, you’re okay?",PENNY,LEONARD
7331,"Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”",SHELDON,SHELDON
7332,Guilty as charged. I’m out.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7333,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.,SHELDON,LEONARD

7497,Who’s he?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7498,"I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7499,"Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.",PENNY,PENNY
7500,"Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?",PENNY,LEONARD
7501,"How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?",OTHERS,RAJ
7502,That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?,SHELDON,PENNY
7503,"Oh, five more minutes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7504,"I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered.",RAJ,LEONARD
7505,"Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.",LEONARD,PENNY
7506,"If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7507,"Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7508,"He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap.",OTHERS,PENNY
7509,"And, sorry about the suitcase.",LEONARD,RAJ
7510,"No, just neighbours.",LEONARD,PENNY
7511,Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.,RAJ,SHELDON
7512,"Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…",HOWARD,OTHERS
7513,"Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7514,I know. Thank you.,PENNY,LEONARD
7515,"Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!",RAJ,SHELDON
7516,"So you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?",LEONARD,RAJ
7517,"Yeah, I know the feeling.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7518,"No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.",LEONARD,HOWARD
7519,Then to avoid Jewish hell?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7520,"Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7521,"Well, I didn’t say I was your father.",HOWARD,RAJ
7522,You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7523,You changed every word.,PENNY,SHELDON
7524,"No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7525,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
7526,It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.,RAJ,LEONARD
7527,He also never had sex in that room. That’s something else to look forward to.,HOWARD,PENNY
7528,Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7529,"He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.",RAJ,PENNY
7530,"Yeah, there kind of does.",LEONARD,PENNY
7531,"Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7532,As long as I don’t have to watch with him.,HOWARD,OTHERS
7533,Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.,HOWARD,PENNY
7534,"That’s a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7535,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7536,"How those nipples feeling, chief?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7537,"Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.",PENNY,SHELDON
7538,"It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.",RAJ,PENNY
7539,I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7540,"Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7541,"Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7542,"That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.",SHELDON,PENNY
7543,14.,PENNY,RAJ
7544,"Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?",PENNY,LEONARD
7545,Brobdingnagian.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7546,Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7547,Do whatever you want.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7548,Sheldon.,PENNY,RAJ
7549,"Yeah, yeah, I know.",PENNY,PENNY
7550,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7551,See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.,PENNY,RAJ
7552,"Yeah, I don’t care, I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with.",PENNY,LEONARD
7553,At least I have an egg. What do you have?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7554,"Wait, what?",PENNY,PENNY
7555,"Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift.",OTHERS,HOWARD
7556,"Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7557,"Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7558,"Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7559,"Click. Now, are there air bags?",SHELDON,LEONARD
7560,"An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7561,"If you’re tired, have some coffee.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7562,Why were you keeping this a secret?,PENNY,OTHERS
7563,"Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.",PENNY,LEONARD
7564,Really?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7565,Which he only did once.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7566,"No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7567,"I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7568,Of course I was.,OTHERS,PENNY
7569,"Good-bye, Mother.",LEONARD,PENNY
7570,The plural of coccyx is coccyges.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7571,I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.,OTHERS,HOWARD
7572,"I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.",RAJ,LEONARD
7573,Are you sure?,RAJ,SHELDON
7574,"Yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape.",RAJ,LEONARD
7575,Why?,RAJ,SHELDON
7576,Here. Open it.,PENNY,OTHERS
7577,No.,HOWARD,PENNY
7578,"Really, they have your little name label in them.",PENNY,PENNY
7579,Where’s Sheldon?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7580,What are you doing here?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7581,"Be the ball, Howard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7582,That’s kind of between me and…,LEONARD,SHELDON
7583,To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7584,I got you the lamb kabob.,LEONARD,RAJ
7585,Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?,LEONARD,PENNY
7586,He’s okay?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7587,"No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7588,"Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.",LEONARD,PENNY
7589,"Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.",SHELDON,RAJ
7590,Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7591,Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?,LEONARD,HOWARD
7592,"When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.",LEONARD,RAJ
7593,What? We’re getting married that Sunday.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7594,I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7595,"Eight o’clock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.",PENNY,SHELDON
7596,Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?,SHELDON,HOWARD
7597,Bye.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7598,Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.,SHELDON,PENNY
7599,Dungeons & Dragons.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7600,"Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?",RAJ,LEONARD
7601,Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.,RAJ,SHELDON
7602,All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7603,"So, what’s going on?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7604,"Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7605,Well…,SHELDON,PENNY
7606,"Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7607,"All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7608,"Okay, I guess we only have one option.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7609,"Morning, Jimmy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7610,I look forward to it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7611,"I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7612,And turned their phones off.,SHELDON,PENNY
7613,"Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7614,I was wearing size a million pants.,SHELDON,PENNY
7615,Aw!,LEONARD,OTHERS
7616,"Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7617,"Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7618,Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.,SHELDON,RAJ
7619,"Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7620,What about you?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7621,"As much as I appreciate this, I can’t accept it, okay? Halley’s my goddaughter, I don’t take care of her for money.",RAJ,OTHERS
7622,You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7623,Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7624,That is so hot.,PENNY,HOWARD
7625,"I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?",OTHERS,RAJ
7626,"Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7627,"Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7628,Shh-shh-shh!,LEONARD,LEONARD
7629,"Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7630,Nobody wants that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7631,"Fine, I’ll publish.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7632,"Hmm. Uh, let me see something.",RAJ,SHELDON
7633,"Oh, hi. What’s up?",PENNY,LEONARD
7634,You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7635,"No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7636,Every night.,RAJ,OTHERS
7637,No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7638,What are you talking about? We’re fine.,PENNY,PENNY
7639,"Thank you, Leonard.",SHELDON,OTHERS
7640,Got it. Should have been a dentist.,OTHERS,OTHERS
7641,"Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7642,"Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.",HOWARD,PENNY
7643,"Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7644,Hysterical.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7645,Wow. Anything else?,PENNY,LEONARD
7646,"Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.",SHELDON,RAJ
7647,"Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.",RAJ,LEONARD
7648,"Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.",PENNY,SHELDON
7649,"Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7650,And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?,PENNY,HOWARD
7651,"You betrayed us for money, who are you?",LEONARD,HOWARD
7652,"Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7653,You know he won’t be looking at other girls.,RAJ,LEONARD
7654,"Fellas, please.",PENNY,PENNY
7655,"Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.",PENNY,PENNY
7656,"You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?",PENNY,SHELDON
7657,How long have you had this secret account?,PENNY,SHELDON
7658,"Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7659,That’s great. I didn’t know you wanted to go back to school.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7660,"Oh, for god’s sakes.",LEONARD,OTHERS
7661,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7662,Nice motivational speech from the team captain.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7663,"Oh, Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7664,What? I didn’t sign it yet.,SHELDON,HOWARD
7665,"Oh my God, I need help.",PENNY,PENNY
7666,"I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.",OTHERS,OTHERS
7667,"Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.",PENNY,PENNY
7668,"Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7669,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7670,"All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?",LEONARD,OTHERS
7671,Is that the hot tub?,HOWARD,SHELDON
7672,"Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?",LEONARD,PENNY
7673,Uh…,LEONARD,PENNY
7674,No. Wait. Send more underwear.,HOWARD,HOWARD
7675,You still see her?,PENNY,PENNY
7676,You want me to leave the apartment?,SHELDON,PENNY
7677,Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.,RAJ,SHELDON
7678,"What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7679,"Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7680,"Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.",LEONARD,OTHERS
7681,"Uh, I guess I am.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7682,"So, what is she doing today?",HOWARD,SHELDON
7683,"Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food.",PENNY,SHELDON
7684,"You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7685,What did the toaster oven ever do to you?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7686,"Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7687,"Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7688,"Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…",LEONARD,LEONARD
7689,"Damn it, I got cocky.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7690,"Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…",LEONARD,PENNY
7691,"I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute.",OTHERS,PENNY
7692,I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7693,"No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7694,"I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7695,"Stuart, now.",SHELDON,PENNY
7696,"Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.",PENNY,SHELDON
7697,"But. Oh, this changes everything.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7698,"Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.",PENNY,SHELDON
7699,So?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7700,"Oh, right, sorry.",PENNY,LEONARD
7701,So when will you reopen?,SHELDON,OTHERS
7702,And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.,OTHERS,PENNY
7703,"Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, and I’ll be your host, because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?",PENNY,SHELDON
7704,"Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7705,"If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?",PENNY,RAJ
7706,"I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7707,"You are such a wimp. She didn’t like it, now you don’t like it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7708,"Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7709,"Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7710,"So what, you’ve already got Penny.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7711,"Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7712,"Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.",HOWARD,LEONARD
7713,Here’s your tea.,OTHERS,HOWARD
7714,I’m in.,PENNY,PENNY
7715,I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7716,"No, she’s not.",LEONARD,PENNY
7717,What’s going on?,HOWARD,PENNY
7718,That’s what she said.,RAJ,RAJ
7719,"Either way, I get nothing.",HOWARD,HOWARD
7720,Hello.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7721,"Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.",OTHERS,PENNY
7722,"Don’t worry, you’ll find another job.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7723,Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?,PENNY,SHELDON
7724,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7725,"Go ahead, eat it. I dare you",PENNY,SHELDON
7726,"Oh, hey.",PENNY,SHELDON
7727,"Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.",RAJ,PENNY
7728,"This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.",RAJ,LEONARD
7729,Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.,LEONARD,PENNY
7730,"But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.",RAJ,SHELDON
7731,What are you talking about?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7732,Penny.,SHELDON,HOWARD
7733,"All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.",RAJ,LEONARD
7734,"Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?",LEONARD,LEONARD
7735,"Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7736,Now?,PENNY,SHELDON
7737,What’s going on?,LEONARD,SHELDON
7738,"Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7739,"Yeah, you’re out of line.",PENNY,RAJ
7740,"Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7741,As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7742,Bert’s a geologist.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7743,"Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…",RAJ,LEONARD

7745,"How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7746,"No, I just thought it would be…",OTHERS,SHELDON
7747,How’d it go?,HOWARD,SHELDON
7748,"Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7749,Yes.,SHELDON,HOWARD
7750,It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7751,Why would you do that?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7752,We should call the police.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7753,"You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7754,Stop it!,LEONARD,LEONARD
7755,"Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.",RAJ,LEONARD
7756,Mom.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7757,Right.,PENNY,OTHERS
7758,"I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7759,What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?,LEONARD,HOWARD
7760,"Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7761,"Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7762,Is this true?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7763,"Oh, I guess I was wrong.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7764,"How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?",SHELDON,SHELDON
7765,"Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?",LEONARD,PENNY
7766,Without shoes?,SHELDON,LEONARD
7767,I don’t know.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7768,What will you tell Amy?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7769,Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7770,What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7771,"Okay, he gets how cool it is.",LEONARD,OTHERS
7772,I feel very comfortable around you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7773,I’m sure she’ll still love him.,LEONARD,RAJ
7774,"Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!",SHELDON,SHELDON
7775,Hang on.,LEONARD,HOWARD
7776,I’m sorry. What did you want to say?,RAJ,SHELDON
7777,I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.,OTHERS,LEONARD
7778,Because her life wasn’t enough?,HOWARD,HOWARD
7779,"Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane.",HOWARD,PENNY

7787,Oh come on. What do I have to do?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7788,Just hang on.,LEONARD,PENNY
7789,"I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7790,"Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.",SHELDON,RAJ
7791,"I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7792,"Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?",RAJ,HOWARD
7793,What do you mean?,PENNY,HOWARD
7794,"Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7795,Alright. Goodnight.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7796,"Oh, that’s clever.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7797,"It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7798,"Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.",LEONARD,PENNY
7799,Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7800,"Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.",LEONARD,PENNY
7801,"Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.",SHELDON,RAJ
7802,We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.,SHELDON,RAJ
7803,I’ve got a better solution.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7804,Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?,SHELDON,OTHERS
7805,Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.,RAJ,SHELDON
7806,Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7807,"If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.",SHELDON,PENNY

7809,"Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.",HOWARD,PENNY
7810,Thank you.,LEONARD,RAJ
7811,"Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7812,"Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.",PENNY,PENNY
7813,Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?,SHELDON,PENNY
7814,It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?,OTHERS,PENNY
7815,Right. Fascinate me.,OTHERS,RAJ

7819,I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.,PENNY,SHELDON
7820,"Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7821,Can I be in charge of pricing? I’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7822,Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.,OTHERS,PENNY

7827,I can’t believe this.,OTHERS,OTHERS
7828,"No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?",RAJ,SHELDON
7829,"Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7830,Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.,HOWARD,RAJ
7831,"Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages.",PENNY,PENNY
7832,Afraid not. Do you recognize this?,SHELDON,RAJ
7833,"It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?",LEONARD,OTHERS
7834,"I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?",RAJ,PENNY
7835,You do make a cute elf.,PENNY,SHELDON
7836,"Well, I’ll give him something he’ll understand. Joanie, call the police!",OTHERS,LEONARD
7837,So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.,RAJ,LEONARD
7838,"Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7839,"I know, I’m studying it.",OTHERS,HOWARD
7840,I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7841,"Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…",OTHERS,LEONARD
7842,"If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7843,Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?,SHELDON,SHELDON

7847,"It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?",SHELDON,LEONARD
7848,From the intercom.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7849,"It’s true, you’d rust.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7850,"Congratulations, honey.",HOWARD,RAJ
7851,Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7852,"I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig’em the Frog, Cap’n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.",RAJ,HOWARD
7853,"I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7854,"Pretty good, right?",PENNY,SHELDON
7855,Come on.,LEONARD,PENNY
7856,"Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7857,"I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.",OTHERS,PENNY
7858,From the future? How fun and imaginative.,RAJ,LEONARD
7859,"I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7860,"You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7861,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7862,My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.,SHELDON,PENNY
7863,"Just listen. I don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7864,"Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
7865,Take me to a bar with women.,LEONARD,SHELDON
7866,"Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma.",HOWARD,SHELDON
7867,That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.,PENNY,SHELDON
7868,No. Why do you ask?,LEONARD,LEONARD

7873,Why are you doing that?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7874,"Okay, fine, what do you suggest?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7875,That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7876,"You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?",RAJ,SHELDON
7877,You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.,HOWARD,PENNY
7878,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?,SHELDON,HOWARD
7879,Really? Only five?,OTHERS,LEONARD
7880,Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7881,Oh. This is new.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7882,"Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.",HOWARD,RAJ
7883,You win.,PENNY,PENNY
7884,Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?,LEONARD,HOWARD
7885,Right.,HOWARD,SHELDON
7886,"So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?",LEONARD,LEONARD
7887,We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.,HOWARD,RAJ
7888,"Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?",SHELDON,PENNY
7889,"Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t.",RAJ,HOWARD
7890,"Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.",LEONARD,HOWARD

7892,"I mean, I’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7893,I sense you’re trying to tell me something.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7894,Would you talk to her?,HOWARD,SHELDON
7895,Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?,LEONARD,LEONARD
7896,I don’t like this at all.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7897,That’s terrible.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7898,"Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7899,"Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.",OTHERS,SHELDON

7901,"Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mailman.",PENNY,PENNY
7902,"I see. Well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place.",LEONARD,PENNY
7903,Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7904,Wow.,RAJ,HOWARD
7905,"Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
7906,Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7907,"Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors.",SHELDON,LEONARD
7908,"Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.",PENNY,PENNY
7909,"Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?",RAJ,PENNY
7910,Does that mean slutty trolls?,OTHERS,SHELDON
7911,"Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.",OTHERS,PENNY
7912,They’re in a group. I’m scared.,LEONARD,LEONARD
7913,Yes.,HOWARD,LEONARD
7914,Um…,SHELDON,PENNY
7915,"Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.",PENNY,SHELDON
7916,Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?,SHELDON,SHELDON
7917,Really? ‘Cause I love it.,PENNY,LEONARD
7918,I’m the Doppler Effect.,SHELDON,PENNY
7919,Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7920,"Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7921,So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.,SHELDON,PENNY
7922,"You can’t go out, it’s Halo night.",SHELDON,HOWARD
7923,We can fix that. Let’s leave.,LEONARD,HOWARD
7924,I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7925,The best one I ever had!,RAJ,PENNY
7926,"I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7927,"All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.",LEONARD,LEONARD
7928,"So, cocoa?",LEONARD,SHELDON
7929,"Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?",LEONARD,PENNY
7930,"Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.",LEONARD,SHELDON
7931,"Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.",RAJ,LEONARD
7932,You’re right. Just forget it.,PENNY,SHELDON
7933,"Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.",RAJ,SHELDON
7934,"You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.",PENNY,SHELDON
7935,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON

7939,You’re kidding.,PENNY,HOWARD
7940,Okay.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7941,Howard.,OTHERS,HOWARD
7942,"I get that, but why is this so hard?",PENNY,PENNY

7952,Okay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7953,Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?,LEONARD,PENNY
7954,That’s great.,HOWARD,PENNY

7963,"Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.",LEONARD,OTHERS
7964,"Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.",OTHERS,SHELDON
7965,"Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.",RAJ,PENNY
7966,Then what are you?,LEONARD,HOWARD
7967,That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.,SHELDON,PENNY
7968,What do you say?,HOWARD,LEONARD
7969,Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.,LEONARD,PENNY
7970,They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.,OTHERS,RAJ

7973,What do you think.,SHELDON,LEONARD
7974,What?,RAJ,SHELDON
7975,"Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.",SHELDON,LEONARD

7982,"Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.",SHELDON,PENNY
7983,"Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.",SHELDON,LEONARD

7995,What?,PENNY,RAJ
7996,I open the chest.,SHELDON,SHELDON
7997,I wonder what changed her mind.,OTHERS,SHELDON
7998,"Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?",SHELDON,LEONARD

8014,Huh. What is this?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8015,I have always wanted a 3-D printer.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8016,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.,LEONARD,LEONARD

8240,"So, I’m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you’ll be back on top.",SHELDON,HOWARD
8241,Okay.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8242,No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?,SHELDON,LEONARD

8255,He asked me.,LEONARD,HOWARD

8272,Yes. Bernie sure is.,HOWARD,PENNY
8273,"Phone, now.",PENNY,PENNY

8353,I don’t know what my next move is.,HOWARD,LEONARD
8354,"All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8355,Where’d you get a beer?,LEONARD,HOWARD
8356,It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.,LEONARD,PENNY
8357,"Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.",RAJ,SHELDON
8358,But I made it better.,SHELDON,OTHERS
8359,"Uh, keep your mouth off other women.",PENNY,LEONARD

8361,"Uh, Dr. Cooper, that’s not necessary.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8362,"Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?",RAJ,HOWARD

8365,I’m gonna ask her to marry me.,HOWARD,PENNY
8366,So there are some rules.,OTHERS,HOWARD
8367,"Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8368,"And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?",SHELDON,RAJ
8369,"Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?",SHELDON,PENNY
8370,"You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.",PENNY,LEONARD
8371,"I’m coming, you big baby.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8372,"Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.",LEONARD,PENNY

8374,I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8375,"What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?",PENNY,PENNY

8379,Amy has ended our relationship.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8380,Would you like some homemade chili?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8381,"Hmm.  All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.",SHELDON,PENNY
8382,Hey.,RAJ,SHELDON
8383,Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8384,"Go. Come on, Raj.",HOWARD,SHELDON

8388,I guess sometimes I’m silly.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8389,Un-unravelable.,SHELDON,HOWARD
8390,"It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.",RAJ,SHELDON
8391,"Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8392,Really?,SHELDON,RAJ

8394,Come here.,PENNY,LEONARD
8395,"I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say.",OTHERS,HOWARD

8421,"Howard, where you going?",LEONARD,LEONARD
8422,"Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.",SHELDON,SHELDON

8429,Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.,PENNY,LEONARD
8430,The two of us could do it.,OTHERS,LEONARD

8432,"No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8433,"Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in.",SHELDON,PENNY

8447,"Thank you, sir.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8448,You want a TUMS?,RAJ,LEONARD
8449,I answered every question Sheldon.,LEONARD,PENNY
8450,"I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8451,I forbid it.,RAJ,SHELDON
8452,What?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8453,Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8454,"Yeah, I just stopped by to say…  Yeah, so, hi!",LEONARD,SHELDON
8455,"And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8456,"If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.",RAJ,PENNY
8457,"So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?",OTHERS,SHELDON

8471,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY
8472,"Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?",LEONARD,SHELDON

8476,"I’m not happy, it’s the medication, I can’t stop smiling.",RAJ,PENNY
8477,"Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?",SHELDON,PENNY

8479,"Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8480,"Oh, I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.",PENNY,OTHERS

8489,I can’t believe we actually did it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8490,Will you shut up?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8491,"Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8492,"Oh, really? That’s too bad.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8493,"Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her.",LEONARD,LEONARD

8525,You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.,SHELDON,RAJ
8526,It’s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8527,Okay. Why?,PENNY,SHELDON
8528,I feel terrible.,PENNY,PENNY

8560,"Aw, is this your first time?",PENNY,SHELDON
8561,"I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.",SHELDON,SHELDON

8591,I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?,SHELDON,PENNY

8636,"Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone.",PENNY,PENNY
8637,I’m the father.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8638,I was actually thinking about going.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8639,Before taxes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8640,What?,LEONARD,HOWARD
8641,"No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8642,"Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.",SHELDON,PENNY
8643,What the hell was that about?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8644,What are you doing here?,HOWARD,HOWARD
8645,"Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8646,"Okay, well. Guess we’d better get started.",PENNY,SHELDON
8647,"Hmm. Oh, who cares?",SHELDON,PENNY
8648,"We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.",LEONARD,OTHERS
8649,"No. Wait, wait, does it?",PENNY,RAJ
8650,She’s still not answering.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8651,"Well, that part’s true!",LEONARD,PENNY
8652,"I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.",OTHERS,PENNY
8653,I’m not going to punch you.,RAJ,RAJ
8654,"Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8655,"Well, the bra under here ain’t beige.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8656,"Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8657,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8658,I don’t know. We could get married.,PENNY,LEONARD
8659,What you doing?,OTHERS,PENNY
8660,Happy Valentine’s Day!,PENNY,LEONARD
8661,Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?,HOWARD,SHELDON
8662,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8663,"Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8664,"I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.",PENNY,SHELDON
8665,Thank you.,HOWARD,HOWARD
8666,Got it..,LEONARD,SHELDON
8667,"Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.",PENNY,PENNY
8668,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
8669,Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8670,Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?,LEONARD,PENNY
8671,"Why, they’re just toys?",PENNY,LEONARD
8672,But I need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.,OTHERS,SHELDON
8673,But it’s embarrassing.,HOWARD,LEONARD
8674,It is?,OTHERS,LEONARD
8675,"Oh, come on, try me.",PENNY,HOWARD
8676,And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8677,"Fine, Mom. How are you?",LEONARD,HOWARD
8678,"All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.",SHELDON,OTHERS
8679,"Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert.",SHELDON,RAJ
8680,That’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8681,"Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?",PENNY,SHELDON
8682,"You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8683,Like what?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8684,You do realize you own his ass right now.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8685,"Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?",HOWARD,LEONARD
8686,"Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!",SHELDON,SHELDON
8687,"Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.",RAJ,PENNY
8688,"Yes, but not of the same species.",SHELDON,OTHERS
8689,"Hey, what are you talking about?",OTHERS,HOWARD
8690,Would you like to sing karaoke with us.,OTHERS,PENNY
8691,"Oh,  I love it. Oh, that’s great!",LEONARD,LEONARD
8692,"Okay, come on. You know you can do better.",PENNY,LEONARD
8693,"Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.",RAJ,SHELDON
8694,"Um, here’s the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….",LEONARD,LEONARD
8695,"Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8696,You’re overthinking this.,PENNY,OTHERS
8697,Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!,RAJ,LEONARD
8698,"No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.",PENNY,SHELDON
8699,Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?,OTHERS,SHELDON
8700,"Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8701,I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8702,"So, she’s close to curing diabetes?",HOWARD,SHELDON
8703,This isn’t a joke.,HOWARD,LEONARD
8704,We don’t have any kids.,PENNY,RAJ
8705,"Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8706,"Ew, really? Get it out.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8707,I believe that’s what your roommate did to her.,PENNY,SHELDON
8708,"Okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8709,"No, I thought of it all by myself.",HOWARD,OTHERS
8710,Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.,OTHERS,SHELDON
8711,"Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.",PENNY,RAJ
8712,"I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?",SHELDON,PENNY
8713,"Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?",LEONARD,SHELDON
8714,"Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on.",HOWARD,HOWARD
8715,"It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.",PENNY,OTHERS
8716,I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship.,OTHERS,SHELDON
8717,Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that’s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.,OTHERS,OTHERS
8718,What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.,HOWARD,HOWARD
8719,Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?,SHELDON,LEONARD
8720,"Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8721,"Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8722,It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8723,"Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn’t a, a sex dream.",OTHERS,PENNY
8724,You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.,OTHERS,OTHERS
8725,I’m practicing my theremin.,SHELDON,RAJ
8726,"No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.",LEONARD,PENNY
8727,"You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?",OTHERS,PENNY
8728,We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.,LEONARD,RAJ
8729,"Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8730,I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement.,RAJ,SHELDON
8731,Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.,SHELDON,PENNY
8732,I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8733,Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?,OTHERS,HOWARD
8734,Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?,HOWARD,SHELDON
8735,"Captain, what are your orders?",SHELDON,SHELDON
8736,"Penny, can we have a little privacy?",HOWARD,SHELDON
8737,"Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?",SHELDON,LEONARD
8738,Miserable and exhausted.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8739,Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.,RAJ,SHELDON
8740,"Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…",SHELDON,RAJ
8741,That’s sixty feet.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8742,And now the crazy version of what I just said.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8743,"Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.",LEONARD,PENNY
8744,"Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.",SHELDON,RAJ
8745,"You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8746,"Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8747,"Uh, the kitchen’s fine.  Hey, what are you doing?",LEONARD,LEONARD
8748,"I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8749,"You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!",SHELDON,LEONARD
8750,Every idea is better than this idea.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8751,Just drop it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8752,"That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.",HOWARD,HOWARD
8753,Things are good right now.,SHELDON,HOWARD
8754,I know.,RAJ,PENNY
8755,There’s no guy.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8756,Watery?,SHELDON,OTHERS
8757,"Cherry, please!",HOWARD,OTHERS
8758,Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8759,"If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!",SHELDON,PENNY
8760,"No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?",RAJ,LEONARD
8761,Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.,OTHERS,OTHERS
8762,"Wait, where are you going?",SHELDON,SHELDON
8763,"I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know it.",PENNY,PENNY
8764,"Is it me, or does she not look so good?",SHELDON,LEONARD
8765,"You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8766,"Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place.",OTHERS,PENNY
8767,"I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8768,I’m not leaving until you talk to me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8769,"Uh, so, you’ll watch it?",RAJ,HOWARD
8770,"In retrospect, that was clue number two.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8771,"Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?",SHELDON,PENNY
8772,"I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?",OTHERS,LEONARD
8773,It was pretty cool.,LEONARD,RAJ
8774,"The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.",SHELDON,RAJ
8775,"Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8776,Then no.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8777,"You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8778,"Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful….",LEONARD,HOWARD
8779,"Oh, we’re the first ones here.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8780,You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?,SHELDON,HOWARD
8781,"Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8782,I should probably get to work.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8783,You’ll never guess what just happened.,PENNY,SHELDON
8784,"I don’t think that’s possible, dude.",RAJ,OTHERS
8785,These cells come from both of us.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8786,"Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you.",RAJ,HOWARD
8787,"Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.",HOWARD,PENNY
8788,Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?,RAJ,SHELDON
8789,"I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.",RAJ,SHELDON
8790,And you just let him?,RAJ,SHELDON
8791,I know. I thought we’d take yours.,LEONARD,PENNY
8792,"Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8793,See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.,RAJ,LEONARD
8794,Fire demon.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8795,"Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8796,"No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8797,I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8798,Four dozen?,PENNY,SHELDON
8799,Same as when we lost you at the zoo.,LEONARD,OTHERS
8800,Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy.,SHELDON,OTHERS
8801,"Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8802,"Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8803,Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.,HOWARD,LEONARD
8804,Impaired cognitive function.,SHELDON,RAJ
8805,"Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.",LEONARD,PENNY
8806,I wouldn’t.,LEONARD,SHELDON
8807,"I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too.",SHELDON,PENNY
8808,"Gah, I’m not perfect.",PENNY,SHELDON
8809,I’m not sure how I feel about this.,OTHERS,LEONARD
8810,"Look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, Sheldon?",PENNY,LEONARD
8811,One question.,SHELDON,HOWARD
8812,What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8813,Hey.,PENNY,PENNY
8814,"Oh, no.",SHELDON,PENNY
8815,She didn’t take my order.,RAJ,LEONARD
8816,"He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8817,Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.,HOWARD,LEONARD
8818,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?,SHELDON,HOWARD
8819,"Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.",PENNY,LEONARD
8820,"Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?",OTHERS,SHELDON
8821,"Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left.",SHELDON,PENNY
8822,"You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8823,"No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.",HOWARD,OTHERS
8824,"Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch",SHELDON,LEONARD
8825,"Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8826,Yeah.,HOWARD,OTHERS
8827,Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.,PENNY,SHELDON
8828,"I’m sorry. That’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.",HOWARD,HOWARD
8829,What do you want? I didn’t say come in!,LEONARD,SHELDON
8830,Oh.,HOWARD,PENNY
8831,I have money.,SHELDON,HOWARD
8832,He’s been murdered by someone in this room.,RAJ,LEONARD
8833,"Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.",RAJ,LEONARD
8834,Bleeding from my ears.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8835,"Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8836,"Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.",SHELDON,PENNY
8837,You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?,PENNY,SHELDON
8838,"Me, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
8839,"Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.",PENNY,HOWARD
8840,That seems like a bit of an overreaction.,SHELDON,LEONARD
8841,Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.,SHELDON,PENNY
8842,"Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.",RAJ,PENNY
8843,How’s it going in there?,OTHERS,RAJ
8844,"Hey, how are things going with your parents?",PENNY,LEONARD
8845,Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?,HOWARD,LEONARD
8846,"Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.",PENNY,SHELDON
8847,"Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8848,Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8849,"We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?",SHELDON,SHELDON
8850,"All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?",SHELDON,LEONARD
8851,I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.,LEONARD,OTHERS
8852,And go where?,PENNY,SHELDON
8853,"Oh, that is so sad.",PENNY,SHELDON
8854,"It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.",PENNY,SHELDON
8855,"Oh, it was fine.",PENNY,LEONARD
8856,"No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.",RAJ,SHELDON
8857,"Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8858,Really?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8859,Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?,LEONARD,PENNY
8860,"Oh, it’s better than a train.",OTHERS,PENNY
8861,"Hey, Howard?",LEONARD,LEONARD
8862,"Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to.",HOWARD,LEONARD
8863,"Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?",LEONARD,PENNY
8864,"Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire.",RAJ,PENNY
8865,"All right, I’m ready for my next question.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8866,Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.,PENNY,SHELDON
8867,"I, I wasn’t going to.",PENNY,HOWARD
8868,"Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.",PENNY,LEONARD
8869,"Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.",HOWARD,SHELDON
8870,I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.,HOWARD,SHELDON
8871,"Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.",SHELDON,PENNY
8872,"Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?",LEONARD,SHELDON
8873,"Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.",SHELDON,HOWARD
8874,Any questions?,RAJ,RAJ
8875,"Oh, that’s awful.",PENNY,SHELDON
8876,"Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.",PENNY,SHELDON
8877,Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?,OTHERS,PENNY
8878,Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?,LEONARD,LEONARD
8879,Those things can still happen.,LEONARD,HOWARD
8880,Here’s your vest back.,OTHERS,SHELDON
8881,"No, I, I get that.",OTHERS,HOWARD
8882,"Emily, what do you do?",OTHERS,LEONARD
8883,"Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.",LEONARD,SHELDON
8884,"Wuh, Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8885,"My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.",LEONARD,PENNY
8886,"It’s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.",OTHERS,PENNY
8887,I’ll take my chances.,LEONARD,LEONARD
8888,"There is no Leo, how can you say that?",LEONARD,HOWARD
8889,"You always say that, but we never do.",RAJ,PENNY
8890,Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
8891,It doesn’t?,LEONARD,PENNY
8892,"Hi, bestie.",OTHERS,SHELDON
8893,Why?,SHELDON,HOWARD
8894,"It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.",SHELDON,LEONARD
8895,"There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving my point, little lady.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8896,"She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.",LEONARD,HOWARD
8897,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,HOWARD
8898,Yes.,SHELDON,RAJ
8899,That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?,OTHERS,RAJ
8900,"Uh, yeah, experimental physics.",LEONARD,LEONARD
8901,"I know how it feels, too.",OTHERS,PENNY
8902,I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.,PENNY,LEONARD
8903,"Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?",PENNY,LEONARD
8904,Be more specific.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8905,I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.,RAJ,SHELDON
8906,Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.,OTHERS,SHELDON
8907,"Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.",LEONARD,RAJ
8908,"Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.",LEONARD,PENNY
8909,"Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation.",OTHERS,PENNY
8910,"Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.",RAJ,PENNY
8911,What’s wrong?,OTHERS,SHELDON

Game on.",HOWARD,SHELDON

8938,Maybe there won’t be one.,OTHERS,LEONARD

8968,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
8969,That’s your big revelation?,PENNY,SHELDON
8970,"Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.",SHELDON,SHELDON
8971,"Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.",SHELDON,HOWARD

8981,More than this?,LEONARD,SHELDON
8982,"You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.",SHELDON,RAJ

9030,Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?,HOWARD,HOWARD

9482,Girls’ night? What does that entail?,OTHERS,SHELDON
9483,"Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9484,I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.,HOWARD,SHELDON
9485,That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.,LEONARD,HOWARD
9486,"I’m very hungry. For food, right?",LEONARD,LEONARD
9487,"Well, I’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!",HOWARD,SHELDON

9489,"I love you, Amy.",HOWARD,OTHERS
9490,"Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.",RAJ,SHELDON

9492,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.",SHELDON,SHELDON

9494,Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?,HOWARD,SHELDON
9495,What are you guys doing?,LEONARD,HOWARD
9496,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four.",LEONARD,SHELDON

9498,"Oh. Yeah, okay.",LEONARD,LEONARD

9501,"Mmm, no, it isn’t.",PENNY,HOWARD

9504,"Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9505,Hey.,PENNY,SHELDON
9506,"We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?",PENNY,OTHERS
9507,What do you mean?,RAJ,LEONARD
9508,"Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.",PENNY,SHELDON

9516,Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.,SHELDON,OTHERS
9517,"Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.",LEONARD,HOWARD
9518,"That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?",SHELDON,OTHERS
9519,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9520,"Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?",SHELDON,LEONARD
9521,"Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.",LEONARD,RAJ

9531,Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.,LEONARD,PENNY
9532,I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.,OTHERS,LEONARD

9537,Did I misspeak about the ring?,SHELDON,LEONARD
9538,Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?,SHELDON,LEONARD

9541,Was that a science diss?,PENNY,HOWARD

9553,Correct.,RAJ,LEONARD
9554,Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9555,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
9556,"I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9557,"Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?",OTHERS,LEONARD
9558,"Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.",SHELDON,LEONARD

9566,Party’s over! Party’s over!,PENNY,SHELDON
9567,Coming!,SHELDON,PENNY
9568,"How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?",HOWARD,PENNY

The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.",SHELDON,RAJ
9575,What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.,PENNY,SHELDON
9576,"Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.",OTHERS,SHELDON

9591,"Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9592,Sheldon you just can’t dictate…,LEONARD,SHELDON

9603,Nice of you to come for Howard.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9604,"Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.",SHELDON,PENNY

9635,"Oh, you’re kidding me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9636,"Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.",OTHERS,PENNY
9637,These are market research questions. I’m filling out the online registration for your game.,SHELDON,LEONARD

9640,"No, give me the remote.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9641,Not really.,LEONARD,HOWARD
9642,"Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9643,And a joker.,OTHERS,LEONARD
9644,"Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.",PENNY,LEONARD
9645,I did.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9646,Yeah?,HOWARD,PENNY
9647,What do you mean?,LEONARD,HOWARD
9648,"But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.",SHELDON,RAJ

9660,"Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9661,"You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!",LEONARD,OTHERS
9662,That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.,PENNY,LEONARD
9663,She was gonna find out eventually.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9664,I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.,SHELDON,HOWARD
9665,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?",OTHERS,OTHERS
9666,What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.,LEONARD,PENNY
9667,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9668,What are you talking about?,PENNY,LEONARD
9669,"Oh, hi.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9670,"And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.",RAJ,SHELDON
9671,Gentlemen..,SHELDON,LEONARD
9672,"All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9673,You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don’t want to.,HOWARD,HOWARD
9674,"Uh, not yet, but I will.",PENNY,SHELDON
9675,What’s wrong with the way I run?,HOWARD,LEONARD
9676,"So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.",RAJ,LEONARD
9677,"Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong.",LEONARD,OTHERS
9678,Yeah.,OTHERS,LEONARD

9681,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9682,"Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.",RAJ,OTHERS
9683,"Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.",LEONARD,OTHERS
9684,"Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.",LEONARD,PENNY
9685,"Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.",PENNY,LEONARD
9686,"Almost there, almost there, almost there.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9687,Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?,PENNY,SHELDON
9688,"Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.",SHELDON,HOWARD
9689,She’s not coming back.,LEONARD,HOWARD
9690,"I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?",HOWARD,PENNY
9691,Don’t remember. Please sit down.,HOWARD,LEONARD
9692,"Hey, Stuart.",RAJ,LEONARD
9693,"Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9694,"All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9695,"Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?",LEONARD,SHELDON
9696,"Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9697,"We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9698,"She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…",LEONARD,RAJ
9699,"Oh, me.",LEONARD,HOWARD
9700,Did you get in?,RAJ,SHELDON
9701,"She did soften your life, didn’t she?",PENNY,LEONARD
9702,You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.,PENNY,LEONARD
9703,There were only two people there?,LEONARD,SHELDON
9704,"In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?",SHELDON,SHELDON
9705,Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9706,"I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.",LEONARD,PENNY
9707,Why are you smiling?,SHELDON,PENNY
9708,Shouldn’t you check your database?,SHELDON,LEONARD
9709,Who?,SHELDON,LEONARD
9710,"You’re right, I’m sorry.  I’m not!",LEONARD,SHELDON
9711,"Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.",PENNY,PENNY
9712,I really appreciate this.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9713,"I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9714,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9715,"Oh, did you hear from Wil?",RAJ,HOWARD
9716,"Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.",SHELDON,PENNY
9717,You’ve heard of him?,LEONARD,HOWARD
9718,"I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.",RAJ,HOWARD
9719,We sure did.,PENNY,HOWARD
9720,"No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.",RAJ,LEONARD
9721,"Don’t listen to her. You and I go way back, we’re like brothers.",HOWARD,SHELDON
9722,I don’t want to talk to anybody.,HOWARD,SHELDON
9723,"No, but you can have mine.",LEONARD,HOWARD
9724,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.,LEONARD,RAJ
9725,They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.,OTHERS,LEONARD
9726,"Okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9727,"Yeah, they’re very considerate that way.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9728,"Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?",HOWARD,SHELDON
9729,All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.,OTHERS,HOWARD
9730,"I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9731,"Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.",SHELDON,PENNY
9732,"Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work out.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9733,I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.,RAJ,SHELDON
9734,Pro?,OTHERS,HOWARD
9735,I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.,SHELDON,PENNY
9736,"No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.",RAJ,LEONARD
9737,"Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.",SHELDON,PENNY
9738,Hey.,LEONARD,HOWARD
9739,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?,SHELDON,HOWARD
9740,"Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.",PENNY,SHELDON
9741,"Excuse me, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9742,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9743,Your attendance implies it’s not.,LEONARD,LEONARD

9745,"Nothing, I’m fine.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9746,"Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9747,"Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.",SHELDON,PENNY
9748,Sure.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9749,"I must say, Penny, this is great fun.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9750,Maybe your dad’s right.,HOWARD,LEONARD

9753,She doesn’t baby me.,HOWARD,SHELDON
9754,"How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9755,Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9756,Right. To Howard.,LEONARD,HOWARD
9757,I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?,SHELDON,RAJ
9758,"Well, then it’s settled.",SHELDON,PENNY
9759,I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.,OTHERS,HOWARD
9760,"Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.",RAJ,PENNY
9761,"The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9762,I think it’s an old storage room.,RAJ,PENNY
9763,"Well, he could bring the baby here.",RAJ,LEONARD
9764,"Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9765,Oh. Wow. Good for you.,PENNY,PENNY
9766,Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.,HOWARD,SHELDON
9767,Sheldon Cooper?,PENNY,SHELDON
9768,Leonard? Are you sleeping?,SHELDON,PENNY
9769,"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9770,Texas.,SHELDON,PENNY
9771,Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9772,I guess.,PENNY,SHELDON
9773,"I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9774,"As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.",PENNY,PENNY
9775,"Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.",HOWARD,SHELDON
9776,"That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9777,"As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila.",HOWARD,SHELDON
9778,"Oh, that’s cool.",LEONARD,HOWARD
9779,"Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?",RAJ,SHELDON
9780,Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.,OTHERS,RAJ
9781,"I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9782,"Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9783,Cool. I think I just learned something.,OTHERS,LEONARD
9784,Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9785,"A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.",RAJ,SHELDON
9786,Hoo.,OTHERS,PENNY
9787,"Hello, Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9788,"Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9789,Perfect.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9790,Aren’t you just made of sugar.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9791,"Yes, what?",HOWARD,SHELDON
9792,"So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?",RAJ,LEONARD
9793,What were you doing at Penny’s?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9794,What’s wrong with your closet?,SHELDON,LEONARD
9795,Now three times fast?,RAJ,SHELDON
9796,"Well, aren’t you sweet. Just for the record, you’d remember a night with me for the rest of your life.",OTHERS,OTHERS
9797,"So, what’s for dinner?",HOWARD,LEONARD
9798,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.,SHELDON,HOWARD
9799,"Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.",PENNY,LEONARD
9800,I kind of like chicken fingers.,RAJ,RAJ
9801,How can I make this up to you?,OTHERS,LEONARD
9802,I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.,HOWARD,PENNY
9803,"Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9804,"Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.",HOWARD,SHELDON
9805,"I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.",LEONARD,PENNY
9806,"Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9807,"Fine.  I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I’m just trying to clean up after your mess.  We’ll talk in the morning.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9808,No.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9809,"Sheldon, we can’t let him drive.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9810,"Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up.",LEONARD,OTHERS
9811,"And again, you’re welcome.",OTHERS,PENNY
9812,"All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9813,"Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.",LEONARD,PENNY
9814,"Hey, what’s my share?",PENNY,SHELDON
9815,Absolutely not.,SHELDON,RAJ
9816,"Oh, poor thing.",PENNY,SHELDON
9817,Does he?,HOWARD,SHELDON
9818,"Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.",SHELDON,PENNY
9819,What’s going on?,PENNY,LEONARD
9820,"Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.",HOWARD,PENNY
9821,Incredibly so.,RAJ,LEONARD
9822,I never realized this building was classified.,SHELDON,PENNY
9823,"Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.",PENNY,RAJ
9824,At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.,HOWARD,LEONARD
9825,Sure. I guess.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9826,"I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.",PENNY,RAJ
9827,That’s good.,HOWARD,PENNY
9828,Good night.,OTHERS,PENNY
9829,"I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9830,It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9831,What is your move?,RAJ,SHELDON
9832,Yes?,OTHERS,SHELDON
9833,Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?,OTHERS,PENNY
9834,Shame on her.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9835,"I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9836,Tea does sound nice.,HOWARD,PENNY
9837,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.,RAJ,LEONARD
9838,"We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.",PENNY,RAJ
9839,"The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.",RAJ,PENNY
9840,Shut up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9841,Bye.,SHELDON,RAJ
9842,That was so fast.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9843,"So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?",HOWARD,SHELDON
9844,"Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?",LEONARD,LEONARD
9845,"Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?",SHELDON,PENNY
9846,"You’re an  actress, correct?",SHELDON,PENNY
9847,I’m really nervous.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9848,Oh.,PENNY,LEONARD
9849,Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.,RAJ,SHELDON
9850,"Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.",HOWARD,OTHERS
9851,"Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.",PENNY,LEONARD
9852,I hate trains.,RAJ,HOWARD
9853,It didn’t come up.,PENNY,SHELDON
9854,"I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…",LEONARD,LEONARD
9855,Right here.,OTHERS,PENNY
9856,"Just saying, no refund for finish early!",OTHERS,SHELDON
9857,But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9858,I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9859,You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.,PENNY,PENNY
9860,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
9861,Fascinating.,SHELDON,OTHERS
9862,We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.,OTHERS,PENNY
9863,Leonard’s asleep.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9864,What do you want?,LEONARD,PENNY
9865,"So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.",HOWARD,SHELDON
9866,You can’t live here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
9867,Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.,SHELDON,PENNY
9868,Thank you. What did he say?,LEONARD,SHELDON
9869,"My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9870,"Oh, yeah?",RAJ,LEONARD
9871,"Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?",SHELDON,HOWARD
9872,I don’t know.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9873,Are you kidding me?,PENNY,HOWARD
9874,You must be here to give me advice.,SHELDON,RAJ
9875,"Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster.",OTHERS,LEONARD
9876,"Yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I’m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to McDonald’s.",SHELDON,PENNY
9877,"No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.",PENNY,HOWARD
9878,"Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.",RAJ,SHELDON
9879,Really. I don’t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.,OTHERS,PENNY
9880,You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.,SHELDON,RAJ
9881,"I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?",SHELDON,LEONARD
9882,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9883,"Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.",SHELDON,PENNY
9884,Would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?,OTHERS,LEONARD
9885,"No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?",PENNY,SHELDON
9886,You did?,RAJ,PENNY
9887,"I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.",SHELDON,PENNY
9888,You’re kidding. You have your own book?,LEONARD,LEONARD
9889,"Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?",PENNY,SHELDON
9890,"Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?",RAJ,LEONARD
9891,I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9892,You saw nothing!,SHELDON,SHELDON
9893,Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.,SHELDON,PENNY
9894,You slipped and fell into a robot hand?,RAJ,LEONARD
9895,"Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance.",SHELDON,OTHERS
9896,"Oh, Madame Curie.",LEONARD,OTHERS
9897,Why?,PENNY,RAJ
9898,How many trains have you been on?,SHELDON,PENNY
9899,Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?,SHELDON,PENNY
9900,"Oh, I’d so do her.",HOWARD,PENNY
9901,"Well, yeah.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9902,"Oh, let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I’ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don’t know where I am.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9903,"Yeah, so is Sheldon.",PENNY,RAJ
9904,You thought she was great in X-Men.,HOWARD,PENNY
9905,"Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9906,"Sheldon, do you want some or not?",OTHERS,SHELDON
9907,Sure.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9908,I’m sorry I brought it up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
9909,He really needs to dial it down.,PENNY,SHELDON
9910,"Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?",OTHERS,LEONARD
9911,"This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9912,"I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.",SHELDON,HOWARD
9913,"Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9914,Aw.,PENNY,SHELDON
9915,"Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9916,"Oh, let me see.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9917,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
9918,"There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess.",OTHERS,OTHERS
9919,"Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?",PENNY,PENNY
9920,No. Bernadette’s working late.,PENNY,OTHERS
9921,So trick her.,SHELDON,RAJ
9922,"No, you most certainly are not.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9923,Yep.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9924,Probably going to have to throw them away.,SHELDON,OTHERS
9925,Yes,LEONARD,SHELDON
9926,"Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?",PENNY,SHELDON
9927,It bothers me.,SHELDON,RAJ
9928,"Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9929,"Oh, good lord.",SHELDON,PENNY
9930,"Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?",PENNY,LEONARD
9931,What’s wrong with a football jersey?,LEONARD,SHELDON
9932,"Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to…  stay right here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9933,"You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9934,You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?,OTHERS,LEONARD
9935,All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9936,I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake.,SHELDON,PENNY
9937,"Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.",OTHERS,OTHERS
9938,How’s that broccoli?,LEONARD,OTHERS
9939,"Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9940,That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.,OTHERS,PENNY
9941,I don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.,SHELDON,PENNY
9942,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.,SHELDON,LEONARD
9943,You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?,OTHERS,SHELDON
9944,"Well, yeah. Why?",PENNY,RAJ
9945,How come you never said she was pregnant?,OTHERS,SHELDON
9946,Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.,HOWARD,PENNY
9947,I don’t know your e-mail.,OTHERS,SHELDON
9948,"Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9949,"Leonard, wait.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9950,I’m thinking about growing a goatee.,HOWARD,PENNY
9951,"Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.",RAJ,HOWARD
9952,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.",PENNY,SHELDON
9953,"Really, oh yay!",PENNY,HOWARD
9954,Why are you all smiling like crazy people?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9955,Got it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
9956,Not a clue. Raj?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9957,I so loathe you.,SHELDON,HOWARD
9958,Since when do you go to spin class?,RAJ,SHELDON
9959,"Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.",SHELDON,LEONARD
9960,"They’re on me today, boys.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9961,"Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9962,"So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other.",PENNY,LEONARD
9963,All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.,SHELDON,PENNY
9964,Would you like a glass of wine?,LEONARD,RAJ
9965,"Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.",LEONARD,LEONARD
9966,What’s a Zune?,OTHERS,RAJ
9967,Whoa.,LEONARD,SHELDON
9968,Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.,LEONARD,PENNY
9969,I feel like I want to cry.,PENNY,SHELDON
9970,How about our roof?,LEONARD,RAJ
9971,I’m sorry. Is that a no?,SHELDON,SHELDON
9972,"My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.",SHELDON,SHELDON
9973,"Don’t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?",PENNY,SHELDON
9974,"Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.",HOWARD,PENNY
9975,"Oh, so am I.",OTHERS,SHELDON
9976,"He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.",HOWARD,LEONARD
9977,"Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.",LEONARD,SHELDON
9978,"No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?",LEONARD,RAJ
9979,Then how ’bout the bathroom?,OTHERS,LEONARD
9980,Yeah.,LEONARD,SHELDON

9988,"All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once.

9996,All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.,PENNY,HOWARD
9997,"Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.",LEONARD,SHELDON

9999,Where the hell d’you find that?,PENNY,LEONARD
10000,"Anyway, thank you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10001,"Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…",OTHERS,HOWARD
10002,"Really? How, how’d we manage that?",LEONARD,PENNY
10003,Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.,HOWARD,SHELDON

10010,Why?,SHELDON,LEONARD
10011,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD

10020,Absolutely. And I’d leave him there.,HOWARD,SHELDON

10031,"Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.",RAJ,SHELDON
10032,"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10033,"I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.",PENNY,LEONARD
10034,"Ooh, I love your shoes.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10035,What are you eating?,RAJ,PENNY
10036,Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.,RAJ,LEONARD
10037,Were you seeing other women when we started dating?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10038,"Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?",HOWARD,HOWARD
10039,"We love you, too.",OTHERS,PENNY
10040,"Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10041,‘Cause it’s embarrassing.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10042,He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10043,Hey.,HOWARD,PENNY
10044,"Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…",SHELDON,RAJ
10045,"I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10046,"Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.",OTHERS,PENNY
10047,"All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?",RAJ,SHELDON
10048,Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
10049,And who performed that heroic act?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10050,"Sheldon, let it go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10051,"Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.",RAJ,LEONARD
10052,"Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.",OTHERS,OTHERS
10053,Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.,SHELDON,LEONARD
10054,"Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?",SHELDON,SHELDON
10055,"Well, you’d have a terrific chance. I mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.",PENNY,PENNY
10056,"If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?",PENNY,SHELDON
10057,"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?",SHELDON,LEONARD
10058,"I, I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?",PENNY,PENNY
10059,"Oh, he’s our fan.",HOWARD,HOWARD
10060,"To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10061,"Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.",SHELDON,PENNY
10062,"Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.",SHELDON,PENNY
10063,"Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10064,Leonard is going to  the office.,SHELDON,PENNY
10065,What the hell is that thing?,HOWARD,PENNY
10066,"Howard, listen to me.",LEONARD,OTHERS
10067,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
10068,I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.,SHELDON,RAJ
10069,"Come on, everyone to the hospital.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10070,On Caprica night?,RAJ,PENNY
10071,"Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.",RAJ,SHELDON
10072,Are you sure?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10073,That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10074,"Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.",SHELDON,OTHERS
10075,"It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10076,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
10077,"Uh, no, thanks.",PENNY,PENNY
10078,You’re not making me feel better.,OTHERS,HOWARD
10079,Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?,RAJ,RAJ
10080,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?,RAJ,SHELDON
10081,"I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10082,"Okay, well, what’s your plan?",HOWARD,OTHERS
10083,"Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10084,I can’t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10085,What else do we know about him?,RAJ,SHELDON
10086,"Ah, ah.",LEONARD,PENNY
10087,Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10088,You’re in my spot.,SHELDON,RAJ
10089,Don’t send him away. Let him in.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10090,"In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?",RAJ,PENNY
10091,"Thanks, but we’ve got it covered.",LEONARD,PENNY
10092,"Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10093,"No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10094,Sure.,PENNY,SHELDON
10095,"No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.",PENNY,RAJ
10096,"Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.",HOWARD,LEONARD
10097,"I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10098,"Well, maybe that’s what I was going for.",PENNY,SHELDON
10099,It was its own point. Go on.,SHELDON,HOWARD
10100,"Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10101,We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.,RAJ,SHELDON
10102,"So, when could we start?",SHELDON,SHELDON
10103,What ring?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10104,"Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10105,"Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10106,"So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10107,"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10108,Seventy-five percent?,HOWARD,LEONARD
10109,Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10110,"This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.",OTHERS,HOWARD
10111,"Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10112,"Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10113,Why is it going so slow?,OTHERS,LEONARD
10114,Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10115,Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?,HOWARD,LEONARD
10116,Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10117,"Okay, just one question. What?",PENNY,PENNY
10118,"I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you.",HOWARD,PENNY
10119,"Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?",RAJ,PENNY
10120,So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10121,What does it say?,RAJ,LEONARD
10122,"You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10123,Anything you want.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10124,"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10125,"Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10126,"If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions.",HOWARD,LEONARD
10127,"Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.",SHELDON,OTHERS
10128,No one can go with you?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10129,"This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10130,How many sips of that beer did he have?,RAJ,PENNY
10131,"Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?",PENNY,SHELDON
10132,"Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?",LEONARD,SHELDON
10133,What? Why?,RAJ,SHELDON
10134,"Um, I think so. Why?",PENNY,HOWARD
10135,"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10136,"No, he’d just take it the wrong way.",PENNY,SHELDON
10137,"But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.",PENNY,PENNY
10138,No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.,PENNY,PENNY
10139,"Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10140,"That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10141,"Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?",PENNY,SHELDON
10142,No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?,RAJ,RAJ
10143,"I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.",RAJ,PENNY
10144,Who is he?,LEONARD,LEONARD
10145,"Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.",LEONARD,OTHERS
10146,"I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10147,"Oh, now what?",OTHERS,SHELDON
10148,"Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10149,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
10150,"Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10151,"Okay, let’s keep it moving.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10152,Keep filling this one with babies. She’s good.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10153,Why would it be too big a step?,RAJ,SHELDON
10154,"Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10155,Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.,RAJ,LEONARD
10156,Right. Be polite.,LEONARD,PENNY
10157,"Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to.",PENNY,HOWARD
10158,"That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.",RAJ,SHELDON
10159,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10160,"Oh, it’s not bad. Kind of hungry.",PENNY,OTHERS
10161,"No one’s arguing with you, dude.",RAJ,SHELDON
10162,"Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.",SHELDON,HOWARD
10163,"Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?",SHELDON,PENNY
10164,Woof.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10165,Big fight with my mother.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10166,You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.,PENNY,LEONARD
10167,Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!,SHELDON,SHELDON
10168,"Boy, I’d love to see that.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10169,"Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10170,"Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.",SHELDON,PENNY
10171,"Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.",SHELDON,PENNY
10172,"All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10173,"Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10174,Okay. I get it. I get it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10175,"Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.",LEONARD,PENNY
10176,Thank you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10177,"The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.",SHELDON,RAJ
10178,I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?,PENNY,SHELDON
10179,"They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10180,New pants?,HOWARD,SHELDON
10181,"No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.",RAJ,HOWARD
10182,"Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?",OTHERS,LEONARD
10183,"Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.",OTHERS,HOWARD
10184,No. I already asked.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10185,"Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?",LEONARD,PENNY
10186,Wow. You poor thing.,PENNY,SHELDON
10187,Sheldon. You’re being rude.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10188,Is that a problem?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10189,"Yes, but I saw it from the front.",HOWARD,SHELDON
10190,The… the picture’s breaking up.,RAJ,LEONARD
10191,Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?,LEONARD,PENNY
10192,Top o’ the mornin’o ya!,HOWARD,SHELDON
10193,"You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…",RAJ,LEONARD
10194,"A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10195,"Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.",PENNY,RAJ
10196,No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.,SHELDON,SHELDON

10199,"So, when is it?",PENNY,PENNY
10200,Yay.,RAJ,PENNY

10203,Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10204,What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?,SHELDON,SHELDON

10212,Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.,HOWARD,HOWARD

10215,What was your first clue?,LEONARD,PENNY
10216,"Oh, good.",RAJ,SHELDON
10217,"Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10218,"I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I’ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there’s an application for this technology, and we’re interested in funding your research.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10219,Great. I’ll go get my stuff.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10220,"Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.",LEONARD,SHELDON

10237,"No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.",PENNY,LEONARD

10243,Sheldon.,LEONARD,PENNY

10245,"Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10246,"No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?",LEONARD,PENNY

10306,"I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s assistant. Can I help you?",OTHERS,HOWARD
10307,"Sheldon, it’s fine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10308,I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.,SHELDON,PENNY
10309,Sheldon.,PENNY,SHELDON
10310,It was not a great trip.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10311,"Yeah, sure.",LEONARD,PENNY
10312,Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.,LEONARD,PENNY
10313,There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.,RAJ,LEONARD

10320,Our Penny’s a star.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10321,You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10322,You suck so hard.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10323,"Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all.",RAJ,SHELDON
10324,He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10325,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10326,Stop it.,LEONARD,RAJ
10327,I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?,SHELDON,PENNY
10328,What do you want.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10329,"Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10330,We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.,SHELDON,LEONARD
10331,"Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.",SHELDON,HOWARD
10332,"Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!",SHELDON,SHELDON

10340,We got him. We’re almost done.,LEONARD,HOWARD
10341,"No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home.",HOWARD,HOWARD
10342,"Oh, boy.",HOWARD,HOWARD
10343,"You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.",PENNY,HOWARD

10345,"To be honest, I did.",SHELDON,PENNY
10346,"Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.",SHELDON,OTHERS

10356,"Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.",PENNY,SHELDON
10357,I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10358,How about Penny’s depressing acting career?,SHELDON,HOWARD
10359,"I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone.",HOWARD,LEONARD
10360,"Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?",PENNY,PENNY
10361,Bye.,HOWARD,LEONARD

10391,So what’s our first pose going to be?,HOWARD,PENNY
10392,"All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10393,"Thanks, Grandma.",SHELDON,PENNY
10394,"You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.",RAJ,PENNY
10395,Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?,OTHERS,PENNY
10396,"Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I’m running away.",HOWARD,SHELDON
10397,"So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.",HOWARD,LEONARD
10398,"No, it’s not gonna do it.",LEONARD,PENNY
10399,He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10400,Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.,PENNY,PENNY
10401,I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10402,"Hey, pal.",HOWARD,SHELDON
10403,"So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?",PENNY,LEONARD
10404,"And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?",PENNY,SHELDON
10405,"From that key maker, I highly doubt it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10406,‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10407,It’s the comic book store.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10408,I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?,PENNY,LEONARD
10409,"Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10410,You doing okay?,OTHERS,PENNY
10411,Oh. That’s so sweet of you.,PENNY,LEONARD
10412,"Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?",PENNY,OTHERS
10413,"I’m, I’m really sorry.",OTHERS,RAJ
10414,"Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10415,Why?,RAJ,SHELDON
10416,She does look happy.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10417,"Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10418,Really? Triumphant?,LEONARD,PENNY
10419,"Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.",HOWARD,HOWARD
10420,Why did you tell Leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?,OTHERS,LEONARD
10421,Like when?,HOWARD,SHELDON
10422,"Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10423,Oh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10424,Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?,LEONARD,PENNY
10425,Okay. If you say so.,SHELDON,LEONARD
10426,I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.,HOWARD,RAJ
10427,"Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.",LEONARD,PENNY
10428,You are so funny.,PENNY,SHELDON
10429,Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?,SHELDON,PENNY
10430,That wasn’t sarcasm?,SHELDON,PENNY
10431,That’s great.,PENNY,SHELDON
10432,Action.,OTHERS,PENNY
10433,"So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.",HOWARD,PENNY
10434,You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.,RAJ,RAJ
10435,"I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?",SHELDON,SHELDON
10436,"Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling.",LEONARD,OTHERS
10437,Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.,PENNY,LEONARD
10438,"When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.",SHELDON,OTHERS
10439,"Thanks, but the thing is I’ll be gone for a few months and I don’t know how Sheldon’s gonna feel about that.",OTHERS,HOWARD
10440,"Oh, I’m counting on it.",OTHERS,OTHERS
10441,"Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.",SHELDON,PENNY
10442,Is that supposed to be funny?,HOWARD,SHELDON
10443,Really should have thought this through.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10444,I guess not.,SHELDON,HOWARD
10445,"A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10446,That’s the Del Taco.,PENNY,SHELDON
10447,Maybe we should just call it a night.,PENNY,OTHERS
10448,"Well, have fun tonight.",PENNY,RAJ
10449,"No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10450,Doesn’t matter.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10451,I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10452,"Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom.",RAJ,PENNY
10453,I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10454,"Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.",RAJ,PENNY
10455,"Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine.",PENNY,SHELDON
10456,"I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.",LEONARD,HOWARD
10457,Hi. Howard Wolowitz.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10458,Sheldon?,OTHERS,PENNY
10459,Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10460,Mouse Boy?,HOWARD,HOWARD
10461,I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.,PENNY,SHELDON
10462,"Well, things would be a little different.",HOWARD,SHELDON
10463,It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.,RAJ,SHELDON
10464,Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.,HOWARD,OTHERS
10465,"Oh, and there’s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter?!",OTHERS,HOWARD
10466,"Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10467,"And the best part is Halley won’t remember a thing. Babies are cute, but they’re dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks I’m gone, then magically I’m back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?",HOWARD,SHELDON
10468,She was my second cousin.,HOWARD,PENNY
10469,"Leonard and Penny, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10470,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10471,"Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10472,"Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?",SHELDON,SHELDON
10473,"Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10474,"I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10475,"Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.",OTHERS,OTHERS
10476,Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10477,Yeah.,OTHERS,PENNY
10478,"Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.",OTHERS,PENNY
10479,No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.,PENNY,PENNY
10480,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10481,"Oh, you don’t want that.",RAJ,SHELDON
10482,"Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10483,There’s a security camera?,LEONARD,SHELDON
10484,I smell nothing.,LEONARD,RAJ
10485,"I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.",PENNY,SHELDON
10486,"You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.",RAJ,SHELDON
10487,Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10488,"Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.",SHELDON,PENNY
10489,"Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.",RAJ,HOWARD
10490,I do that too. But probably in a different way.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10491,They’ve been out there a while.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10492,"Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10493,"So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10494,"Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10495,You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?,LEONARD,PENNY
10496,I don’t sound like that.,RAJ,LEONARD
10497,"Oh, I’ll check Amazon.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10498,Okay.,SHELDON,PENNY
10499,We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?,LEONARD,LEONARD
10500,"Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10501,"Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.",PENNY,LEONARD
10502,"Well, you and I would get our own room, right?",PENNY,SHELDON
10503,Then I’ve been up all night.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10504,"That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10505,Shame on you guys.,PENNY,LEONARD
10506,Don’t you want to know for sure?,PENNY,LEONARD
10507,There it is. What if someone asks?,SHELDON,OTHERS
10508,"Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.",PENNY,SHELDON
10509,"You don’t honestly think that, do you?",LEONARD,PENNY
10510,"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?",SHELDON,LEONARD
10511,Yeah.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10512,Yep.,PENNY,RAJ
10513,"What do you want, Sheldon?",OTHERS,PENNY
10514,I’ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10515,Well how do you feel?,PENNY,LEONARD
10516,"Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.",RAJ,HOWARD
10517,"Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.",RAJ,LEONARD
10518,See what?,RAJ,SHELDON
10519,It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.,LEONARD,PENNY
10520,"No, you bonehead.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10521,"I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.",LEONARD,RAJ
10522,Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?,HOWARD,SHELDON
10523,"I’m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?",OTHERS,SHELDON
10524,Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?,LEONARD,SHELDON
10525,"Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.",LEONARD,PENNY
10526,Ask him.,LEONARD,PENNY
10527,What?,LEONARD,PENNY
10528,"Oh, great, thank you again.",PENNY,LEONARD
10529,I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.,LEONARD,PENNY
10530,"Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.",OTHERS,PENNY
10531,"Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.",LEONARD,PENNY
10532,I’m hammered.,RAJ,SHELDON
10533,"Oh, crap.",OTHERS,PENNY
10534,Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10535,Thank you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10536,"Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you.",RAJ,SHELDON
10537,"Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.",PENNY,LEONARD
10538,Wow.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10539,"I said what’s new, but sure.",OTHERS,PENNY
10540,Ooh. Military?,OTHERS,LEONARD
10541,All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.,SHELDON,LEONARD
10542,Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10543,We’re not back together.,OTHERS,PENNY
10544,Comfy?,OTHERS,PENNY
10545,"I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.",RAJ,HOWARD
10546,"No, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10547,I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.,HOWARD,LEONARD
10548,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10549,That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10550,"Damn you, you rat bastard.",PENNY,RAJ
10551,I love Neil Diamond.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10552,Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.,RAJ,PENNY
10553,Come on. Sorry to bother you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10554,"You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.",SHELDON,RAJ
10555,"Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore.",LEONARD,RAJ
10556,"No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy.",SHELDON,PENNY
10557,"No, thank you.",RAJ,PENNY
10558,I love you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10559,"Yeah, obviously.",PENNY,SHELDON
10560,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.",SHELDON,PENNY
10561,Must you?,SHELDON,LEONARD
10562,"You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.",RAJ,SHELDON
10563,Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?,OTHERS,SHELDON

10692,Would you just let it go?,HOWARD,SHELDON
10693,"What’s the matter, you chicken?",HOWARD,SHELDON
10694,"I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day.

I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin.

10837,"I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.",RAJ,LEONARD
10838,Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10839,"Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10840,I’m going to admonish you.,SHELDON,PENNY
10841,"If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.",SHELDON,RAJ
10842,I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?,LEONARD,PENNY
10843,How many women have you had dates with?,SHELDON,SHELDON

10849,"Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.",RAJ,LEONARD
10850,"Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10851,"No, you’re coming with me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10852,Are you mad at me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
10853,Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?,OTHERS,HOWARD
10854,Thank you. So do you.,PENNY,LEONARD
10855,"Yes, please.  How may I help you?",SHELDON,SHELDON
10856,"Well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.",PENNY,PENNY
10857,She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.,RAJ,SHELDON
10858,It’s Leonard!,HOWARD,SHELDON
10859,"Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10860,What about  Cookies!,LEONARD,PENNY
10861,"Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.",SHELDON,RAJ
10862,"Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know.",PENNY,LEONARD
10863,Cheers.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10864,"Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10865,"Well, we did it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10866,Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10867,Hey. You going somewhere?,OTHERS,LEONARD
10868,In the bathroom.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10869,"A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right?",LEONARD,RAJ
10870,"I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10871,"All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?",SHELDON,LEONARD
10872,"If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10873,Will you be there?,OTHERS,RAJ
10874,Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.,HOWARD,RAJ
10875,I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.,PENNY,LEONARD
10876,Are you feeling any better?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10877,"Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?",LEONARD,LEONARD
10878,"It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it.",LEONARD,PENNY
10879,"Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.",SHELDON,RAJ
10880,"Oh, Howie.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10881,I made an eight o’clock reservation.,LEONARD,RAJ
10882,"Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10883,Why didn’t you tell me?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10884,How dare you?,SHELDON,PENNY
10885,They are in 2003.,SHELDON,PENNY
10886,"Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10887,"Well, don’t give up. Maybe we can fix it.",OTHERS,HOWARD
10888,Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?,SHELDON,OTHERS
10889,"Subtextually, of course.  Just have fun with it.  Morning Penny.",SHELDON,PENNY
10890,Sorry. I’ll get better.,PENNY,LEONARD
10891,Just a little? That’s great.,HOWARD,SHELDON

10893,What about the Science Center?,OTHERS,OTHERS
10894,"Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.",HOWARD,LEONARD
10895,"Hello, Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.",RAJ,PENNY
10896,We give up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10897,Okay. Howard come back.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10898,I thought we were going to be gentle with him.,RAJ,LEONARD
10899,Thank you.,SHELDON,RAJ
10900,I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.,SHELDON,LEONARD
10901,Sorry.,OTHERS,PENNY
10902,"Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10903,"Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon.",PENNY,HOWARD

10908,I am doing it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10909,Oh. He was so excited.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10910,Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.,LEONARD,RAJ
10911,What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10912,"This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?",HOWARD,SHELDON
10913,"Yeah, that’s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!",OTHERS,HOWARD
10914,"Hello, Wil Wheaton.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10915,Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10916,"Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10917,Good. I’m glad.,PENNY,LEONARD
10918,"Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Good morning.",SHELDON,RAJ
10919,"Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?",LEONARD,LEONARD
10920,Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10921,"Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.",SHELDON,PENNY
10922,"Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.",OTHERS,OTHERS
10923,"Okay, come on, moving on.",LEONARD,OTHERS

10927,Got to go. Morning.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10928,"Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.",SHELDON,HOWARD
10929,"Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What’s going on with your brother?",LEONARD,LEONARD
10930,"I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10931,"Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10932,"Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10933,Aw! Raj did the dishes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10934,"No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.",RAJ,LEONARD
10935,"Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.",HOWARD,HOWARD
10936,None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.,SHELDON,RAJ
10937,Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10938,Fine with me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10939,A hundred.,PENNY,LEONARD
10940,Wait for moi.,OTHERS,HOWARD
10941,What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?,LEONARD,OTHERS
10942,Hi.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10943,You want the fruit platter?,PENNY,SHELDON
10944,Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.,SHELDON,HOWARD
10945,"Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.",PENNY,PENNY
10946,"No, I can’t let you do that.",OTHERS,RAJ
10947,I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10948,"Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10949,"Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.",PENNY,PENNY
10950,Howard Wolowitz. Why not World’s Greatest Engineer?,HOWARD,SHELDON
10951,Raj.,PENNY,SHELDON
10952,I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.,SHELDON,HOWARD
10953,There are too many variables. It would take forever.,HOWARD,SHELDON
10954,"I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.",SHELDON,HOWARD
10955,Thank you.,LEONARD,PENNY
10956,Oh God!,HOWARD,OTHERS
10957,I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.,SHELDON,HOWARD
10958,"Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…",RAJ,SHELDON
10959,"No. No, come on, I want to do it.",PENNY,LEONARD
10960,"Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?",LEONARD,LEONARD
10961,"Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?",PENNY,LEONARD
10962,What is that?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10963,"No rush, no rush.",RAJ,PENNY
10964,"Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10965,"Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10966,"Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.",HOWARD,LEONARD
10967,This isn’t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.,OTHERS,LEONARD
10968,Was it your mom?,OTHERS,LEONARD
10969,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
10970,Are you actually gonna dance?,LEONARD,LEONARD
10971,And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?,HOWARD,HOWARD
10972,"Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10973,You sure?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10974,What are you doing?,OTHERS,LEONARD
10975,"Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.",OTHERS,SHELDON
10976,"Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10977,"Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10978,"Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
10979,Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.,LEONARD,LEONARD
10980,"There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.",OTHERS,OTHERS
10981,I have that same underwear.,RAJ,SHELDON
10982,"That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.",SHELDON,OTHERS
10983,"Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.",PENNY,PENNY
10984,Turned to boom-boom.,LEONARD,SHELDON
10985,Why? Are they naughty?,OTHERS,SHELDON
10986,"Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done.",SHELDON,OTHERS
10987,"In all of them, that is the point.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10988,"Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.",LEONARD,LEONARD
10989,"I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.",SHELDON,LEONARD
10990,Why not?,SHELDON,SHELDON
10991,"Oh, I’m sorry.",LEONARD,SHELDON
10992,Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?,OTHERS,PENNY
10993,"Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I’m okay with it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
10994,"This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.",RAJ,LEONARD
10995,Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.,SHELDON,SHELDON
10996,Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?,LEONARD,PENNY
10997,Because I’m mad at you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
10998,"Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.",PENNY,OTHERS
10999,"Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…",RAJ,SHELDON
11000,"Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11001,"Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.",RAJ,PENNY
11002,"Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.",OTHERS,PENNY
11003,"Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?",RAJ,SHELDON
11004,"Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.",PENNY,HOWARD
11005,"Howard, I’m sick.",SHELDON,PENNY
11006,"There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11007,I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.,RAJ,SHELDON
11008,They all look the same to me.,OTHERS,OTHERS
11009,I guess it hasn’t come up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11010,"So, normal.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11011,"Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?",PENNY,OTHERS
11012,I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.,LEONARD,PENNY
11013,"Uh, I know! It’s been a while!",LEONARD,SHELDON
11014,"Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11015,It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.,OTHERS,HOWARD
11016,Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?,OTHERS,LEONARD
11017,My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11018,It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11019,"Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11020,"I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.",SHELDON,PENNY
11021,"Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11022,Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.,PENNY,PENNY
11023,Sheldon will move out eventually.,OTHERS,HOWARD
11024,What’s important?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11025,"Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11026,"I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.",LEONARD,RAJ
11027,I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.,OTHERS,HOWARD
11028,"Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.",PENNY,LEONARD
11029,You bought a minivan?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11030,"You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?",RAJ,LEONARD
11031,Good point. Basket of puppies.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11032,"Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman.",RAJ,SHELDON
11033,How’s she doing?,LEONARD,HOWARD
11034,You have a thing of paper clips right there.,RAJ,PENNY
11035,Oh-oh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11036,"Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats.",RAJ,RAJ
11037,"See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11038,I knew it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11039,Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11040,"She’s an enigma, Raj.",LEONARD,OTHERS
11041,Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.,OTHERS,PENNY

11044,"Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.",LEONARD,PENNY
11045,"Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11046,"That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11047,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11048,"Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place.",PENNY,LEONARD
11049,"Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11050,"I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.",PENNY,LEONARD
11051,"Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11052,"Ooh, what are you gonna get?",PENNY,HOWARD
11053,"Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.",SHELDON,RAJ
11054,Yep.,PENNY,SHELDON
11055,"Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.",RAJ,LEONARD
11056,No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?,PENNY,HOWARD
11057,"Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?",SHELDON,SHELDON
11058,"That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11059,She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11060,"I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.",OTHERS,HOWARD

11062,"You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.",PENNY,HOWARD
11063,Should we take this little party to the bedroom?,PENNY,LEONARD
11064,"Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.",SHELDON,PENNY
11065,"No, absolutely not.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11066,"I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.",OTHERS,PENNY
11067,"No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.",LEONARD,RAJ
11068,They don’t want me.,HOWARD,HOWARD
11069,Great restraint on my part.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11070,I really do.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11071,"Okay, how is that?",PENNY,SHELDON
11072,There’s nothing wrong with the science here.,LEONARD,OTHERS
11073,You think you could be a little more discreet?,HOWARD,SHELDON
11074,That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!,PENNY,SHELDON
11075,"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?",SHELDON,SHELDON
11076,"No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.",RAJ,LEONARD

11086,Sorry about that.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11087,Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11088,I believe you.,LEONARD,LEONARD

11091,All right.. Two of hearts.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11092,This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.,LEONARD,PENNY
11093,You can’t say that anymore.,LEONARD,PENNY
11094,Leonard?Leonard?,SHELDON,LEONARD
11095,"Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11096,Ooh. Happy birthday to me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11097,"What are you going to get, Raj?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11098,Oy.,RAJ,PENNY

11105,"Thank you, but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?",RAJ,SHELDON
11106,"Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose.",PENNY,SHELDON
11107,"No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.",RAJ,HOWARD
11108,And there’s your answer.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11109,"Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11110,Um…,LEONARD,LEONARD
11111,Recognise.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11112,Can I sleep on your couch tonight?,LEONARD,PENNY
11113,"And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it.",SHELDON,PENNY
11114,"No, it’s not.",PENNY,PENNY
11115,Mm-hmm.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11116,"Well, what do you think.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11117,The people from People.,RAJ,PENNY
11118,"Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?",RAJ,SHELDON
11119,Next!,OTHERS,SHELDON
11120,"Penny,  Penny,  Penny.",SHELDON,HOWARD
11121,"Okay, let’s talk about something else.",RAJ,SHELDON
11122,It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11123,"Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.",PENNY,SHELDON
11124,Thank you.,PENNY,SHELDON
11125,You can’t. I’m the lead author.,SHELDON,PENNY
11126,"You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.",RAJ,LEONARD
11127,Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11128,"I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass.",PENNY,LEONARD
11129,"Well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11130,Have they found a match for you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11131,So you’ve never been married?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11132,"No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.",LEONARD,OTHERS
11133,"Yes, that good news.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11134,"Okay, you two have to back off.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11135,"I can’t now, I’m working.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11136,Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?,RAJ,PENNY
11137,"You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.",SHELDON,OTHERS
11138,"I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11139,Are you implementing phase two?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11140,I am taking Penny.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11141,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.,LEONARD,OTHERS
11142,Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?,HOWARD,LEONARD
11143,"Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.",LEONARD,PENNY
11144,Physics..,LEONARD,LEONARD
11145,"Ugh, what?",PENNY,SHELDON
11146,"This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11147,I didn’t dream that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11148,"Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.",PENNY,LEONARD
11149,"Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.",RAJ,SHELDON
11150,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11151,"I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11152,"Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11153,Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11154,"Oh, what the hell. Ooh!",PENNY,SHELDON
11155,So did I.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11156,I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.,RAJ,LEONARD
11157,That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.,RAJ,PENNY
11158,So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11159,"Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.",LEONARD,RAJ
11160,"You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.",RAJ,SHELDON
11161,Are you sure?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11162,You sure you don’t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11163,"Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.",SHELDON,HOWARD
11164,"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.",PENNY,LEONARD
11165,Wow. That is amazing.,PENNY,SHELDON
11166,"Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11167,All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.,RAJ,LEONARD
11168,You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11169,Or instead of me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11170,"Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?",PENNY,SHELDON
11171,Actually it’s not all that easy to find.,LEONARD,PENNY
11172,"We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11173,Nothing. Let’s go to the party.  How do I look?,PENNY,SHELDON
11174,I don’t believe there’s any such thing.,OTHERS,PENNY
11175,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11176,Why not?,LEONARD,PENNY
11177,"Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11178,"Look at this, everyone went chimp.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11179,Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11180,No. Something about a convention.,OTHERS,RAJ
11181,"Hey, guys.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11182,"You miss the blanket now, don’t you?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11183,"Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11184,Do you really think you should be eating that cake?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11185,Really? You don’t sound so sure.,PENNY,LEONARD
11186,"Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11187,Ugh!,PENNY,LEONARD
11188,"Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.",RAJ,SHELDON
11189,You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.,PENNY,SHELDON
11190,"I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?",OTHERS,LEONARD
11191,I suppose that’s one way to look at it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11192,"Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great.",PENNY,SHELDON
11193,"Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun.",PENNY,SHELDON
11194,"Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11195,She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.,OTHERS,RAJ
11196,They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11197,"Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11198,"You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11199,"You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.",RAJ,LEONARD
11200,"Don’t be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11201,I can’t believe you punched Bert.,PENNY,SHELDON
11202,No. Why?,PENNY,PENNY
11203,You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11204,"Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.",OTHERS,PENNY
11205,"Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11206,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11207,Okay.,SHELDON,HOWARD

11210,"My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11211,Howard Wolowitz.,HOWARD,PENNY
11212,"Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11213,"Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11214,"Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.",HOWARD,PENNY
11215,"Darn tootin’, I win.",SHELDON,PENNY
11216,"Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11217,"Hi, honey.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11218,Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.,LEONARD,RAJ
11219,"Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11220,"You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11221,"Yay! If you’ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11222,"Hey, you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.",PENNY,HOWARD
11223,"Oh. I made my wife come down, too.",HOWARD,OTHERS
11224,"Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11225,"If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.",PENNY,LEONARD
11226,"I am, but I’ll miss you guys.",RAJ,LEONARD
11227,"There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11228,I’ll be damned.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11229,Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”,SHELDON,HOWARD
11230,That feels great.,OTHERS,RAJ
11231,"Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11232,"When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?",SHELDON,HOWARD
11233,Making lasagna.,OTHERS,PENNY
11234,"What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?",HOWARD,SHELDON
11235,"Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?",RAJ,SHELDON
11236,Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11237,"Oh, you like to fish?",HOWARD,LEONARD
11238,"Oh. That’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11239,"Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?",PENNY,SHELDON
11240,"Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.",PENNY,SHELDON
11241,Yeah. I guess.,PENNY,LEONARD
11242,"Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves.",SHELDON,HOWARD
11243,"Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.",RAJ,SHELDON
11244,How’d you get ready so fast?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11245,"Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.",HOWARD,PENNY
11246,We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.,RAJ,HOWARD
11247,Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.,PENNY,SHELDON
11248,"Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11249,Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11250,"Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11251,"Ha. Well, that’s what I am, queen of the nerds.",PENNY,OTHERS
11252,Except on a date with anybody.,RAJ,PENNY
11253,"If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.",RAJ,SHELDON
11254,Why?,SHELDON,PENNY
11255,"Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11256,What if someone steals my keys?,SHELDON,LEONARD
11257,Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?,HOWARD,SHELDON
11258,I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11259,"If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?",SHELDON,SHELDON
11260,You’re kidding.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11261,And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.,SHELDON,PENNY
11262,You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.,SHELDON,OTHERS
11263,"Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11264,19th-century technology.,HOWARD,PENNY
11265,"Well, she’s so excited, I can’t do that to her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11266,"Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?",OTHERS,LEONARD
11267,"Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11268,"No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage.",OTHERS,PENNY
11269,Did you say it out loud with words?,PENNY,SHELDON
11270,"Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.",HOWARD,HOWARD
11271,It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11272,"I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…",HOWARD,LEONARD
11273,Oh. Is it Amy?,RAJ,SHELDON
11274,"No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.",PENNY,PENNY
11275,What the hell is that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11276,"Oh, please let me tell him.",PENNY,HOWARD
11277,Don’t you have a guy?,PENNY,SHELDON
11278,"Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.",RAJ,SHELDON
11279,"It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11280,He loves you.,RAJ,SHELDON
11281,"Here’s your tea, Mother.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11282,"Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.",LEONARD,RAJ
11283,"You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11284,"One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11285,"You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11286,"Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11287,"Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11288,"Hey, don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.",RAJ,LEONARD
11289,There’s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.,HOWARD,HOWARD
11290,"Really, what were you hoping for?",PENNY,HOWARD
11291,"Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?",SHELDON,OTHERS
11292,"Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.",SHELDON,RAJ
11293,Ow.,PENNY,SHELDON
11294,"I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?",LEONARD,LEONARD
11295,It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.,PENNY,SHELDON
11296,What are you doing here?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11297,I’d like to try a slippery nipple.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11298,"No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how’s everything going with you and Leonard?",OTHERS,PENNY
11299,You were.,SHELDON,HOWARD
11300,"Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?",HOWARD,SHELDON
11301,"Yes, we here to fix the cable.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11302,"It’s not a date, and that’s racist.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11303,It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11304,"Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.",SHELDON,PENNY
11305,"Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11306,"Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.",OTHERS,SHELDON

11308,Not really.,HOWARD,RAJ
11309,"Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.",RAJ,OTHERS
11310,Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11311,"Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.",RAJ,SHELDON
11312,"It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11313,Talk to the hand.,SHELDON,HOWARD
11314,Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11315,Mmmmmm.,RAJ,PENNY
11316,I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?,OTHERS,RAJ
11317,"So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11318,I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny.,OTHERS,RAJ
11319,"Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.",PENNY,SHELDON
11320,"Oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11321,"Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.",PENNY,PENNY
11322,"Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it.",RAJ,SHELDON
11323,Whee!,SHELDON,RAJ
11324,Good night.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11325,"Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.",LEONARD,PENNY
11326,"Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that’s not irresponsible, I don’t know what is.",SHELDON,RAJ
11327,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11328,"Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!",LEONARD,SHELDON
11329,Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.,HOWARD,PENNY
11330,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11331,"Actually, in this case, I think she was.",RAJ,SHELDON
11332,"The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11333,He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.,LEONARD,PENNY
11334,"He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11335,Moo-stache.,RAJ,LEONARD
11336,"You need to let it go, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11337,I don’t know.,OTHERS,PENNY

11344,"Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me.",PENNY,OTHERS
11345,"Yeah, um, Raj is moving out.",OTHERS,HOWARD
11346,"Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11347,A shower.,PENNY,PENNY
11348,Yup.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11349,"You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.",PENNY,LEONARD
11350,"When you were married, did your wife cook?",OTHERS,OTHERS
11351,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11352,Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11353,Really?,HOWARD,LEONARD
11354,"Probably, but in their own homes.",PENNY,LEONARD
11355,"We all do. Now, how about dinner?",LEONARD,PENNY
11356,Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11357,"And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.",RAJ,LEONARD
11358,Are you guys having problems?,PENNY,OTHERS
11359,"No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.",PENNY,PENNY
11360,"Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.",RAJ,SHELDON
11361,"No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.",PENNY,PENNY
11362,"Okay, we’re all set.",RAJ,OTHERS
11363,I’m sorry. It’s our first time.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11364,You’re all alike.,PENNY,RAJ
11365,What are you talking about?,LEONARD,PENNY
11366,Great.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11367,Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?,OTHERS,LEONARD
11368,English is your native language.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11369,Hang on.,SHELDON,RAJ
11370,"All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11371,"Seven? Look at the board, it’s four.",HOWARD,RAJ
11372,"It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…",LEONARD,SHELDON
11373,"Hey, Leonard?",RAJ,LEONARD
11374,I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11375,"Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up.",HOWARD,RAJ
11376,"I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…",LEONARD,SHELDON
11377,"No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!",OTHERS,SHELDON
11378,"I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.",SHELDON,PENNY
11379,Vigorously?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11380,"I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11381,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11382,Right here. Use your finger.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11383,"All right, come on Sheldon.",PENNY,LEONARD
11384,Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11385,"So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11386,Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.,LEONARD,OTHERS
11387,"Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11388,"Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?",PENNY,LEONARD
11389,"Okay, dig in.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11390,"Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?",HOWARD,LEONARD
11391,"Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.",SHELDON,RAJ
11392,"Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?",OTHERS,RAJ
11393,Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.,OTHERS,RAJ
11394,"Uh, what time is it?",PENNY,OTHERS
11395,You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11396,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11397,That’s not where it was going.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11398,"You know what, I’m going to go back and try talking to her again.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11399,Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?,SHELDON,LEONARD
11400,That’s not it because you’re clearly upset.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11401,"Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11402,"Oh, no!",RAJ,PENNY
11403,"You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”",LEONARD,SHELDON
11404,I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.,SHELDON,OTHERS
11405,"At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11406,Never.,PENNY,SHELDON
11407,And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11408,"It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.",PENNY,LEONARD
11409,What’s the matter?,PENNY,SHELDON
11410,I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11411,Great.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11412,"Hello, Penny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11413,Hi. Nice to meet you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11414,And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11415,"Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11416,Thanks for cooking.,PENNY,OTHERS
11417,"Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11418,"Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.",SHELDON,RAJ
11419,That doesn’t sound terrifying.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11420,You don’t know his girlfriend very well.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11421,But we won’t bore you with the details.,LEONARD,RAJ
11422,"Happy Halloween.  If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11423,She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.,LEONARD,OTHERS
11424,"You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11425,Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?,SHELDON,HOWARD
11426,"Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11427,"Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.",PENNY,LEONARD
11428,Because you are giving your commencement speech.,PENNY,SHELDON
11429,Hold.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11430,Can I invite you in for tea?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11431,I won?,SHELDON,LEONARD
11432,"They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11433,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
11434,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11435,"Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.",PENNY,LEONARD
11436,What does that mean?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11437,"You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–",RAJ,SHELDON
11438,Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.,RAJ,SHELDON
11439,"You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.",PENNY,SHELDON
11440,I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.,SHELDON,PENNY
11441,Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?,OTHERS,LEONARD
11442,It wasn’t a real proposal.,PENNY,LEONARD
11443,"That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.",PENNY,LEONARD
11444,"Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?",HOWARD,LEONARD
11445,Roots?,OTHERS,HOWARD
11446,"Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11447,"I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton.",OTHERS,RAJ
11448,Cinnamon!,HOWARD,SHELDON
11449,I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11450,Come on.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11451,The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11452,I think we’re good.,PENNY,LEONARD
11453,"Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11454,"But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11455,Did he respond yet?,RAJ,LEONARD
11456,Why isn’t it ever Angie Dickinson’s bedroom?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11457,"Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting.",OTHERS,OTHERS
11458,"No, but what is it?",HOWARD,PENNY
11459,Okay. Then what happened?,PENNY,SHELDON
11460,"Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11461,"Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11462,"Yeah, literally, none of it.",RAJ,PENNY
11463,Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn’t even get it started. Hi. Dave.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11464,"Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.",OTHERS,PENNY
11465,I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.,LEONARD,PENNY
11466,That’s really nice to hear.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11467,Don’t.,SHELDON,RAJ
11468,You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.,HOWARD,PENNY
11469,Mm-hmm?,PENNY,OTHERS
11470,What do you mean?,PENNY,SHELDON
11471,"No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11472,"This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11473,"That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11474,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11475,And Princeton.,HOWARD,PENNY
11476,Not there. That’s my spot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11477,Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11478,"Yeah, take whatever you want.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11479,Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.,LEONARD,PENNY
11480,Sure.,OTHERS,HOWARD
11481,"Hey, Sheldon.",PENNY,LEONARD
11482,A little clingy.,OTHERS,PENNY
11483,Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11484,"See, now this is a man for Penny.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11485,Antonio Salieri?,HOWARD,SHELDON
11486,What is wrong with you?,PENNY,SHELDON
11487,"All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.",PENNY,SHELDON
11488,"Sheldon, I’m sure it’s going to be fine.",PENNY,HOWARD
11489,"Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11490,"Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11491,"Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.",RAJ,SHELDON
11492,I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.,PENNY,SHELDON
11493,"Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?",SHELDON,HOWARD
11494,"Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.",LEONARD,RAJ
11495,Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.,OTHERS,OTHERS
11496,Yeah.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11497,And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11498,"Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11499,"Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11500,"Hey, you got a minute?",HOWARD,OTHERS
11501,"Oooh, he’s got me.",RAJ,LEONARD
11502,"Fine. Women, huh?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11503,"So, why haven’t we picked a date?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11504,"A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale.",SHELDON,OTHERS
11505,What did I do?,SHELDON,HOWARD
11506,"Really?  I’m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two.",PENNY,RAJ
11507,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.,RAJ,RAJ
11508,Mom.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11509,She’s right. I’m too hot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11510,250 dollars an hour. Why?,HOWARD,PENNY
11511,I was sleeping.,RAJ,PENNY
11512,See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11513,You ever gonna tell him?,RAJ,SHELDON
11514,Chickens can’t climb trees,RAJ,LEONARD
11515,"Yeah, that’s working out great for me.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11516,"What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?",PENNY,PENNY
11517,Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11518,"What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11519,You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What’s funny?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11520,Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.,RAJ,SHELDON
11521,"Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11522,Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?,LEONARD,HOWARD
11523,We could eat after the movie.,RAJ,PENNY
11524,"Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11525,Keep going.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11526,You called my mother?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11527,This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11528,"Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11529,"Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.",SHELDON,RAJ
11530,"Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11531,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11532,"Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.",OTHERS,PENNY
11533,Does it have melon on it?,LEONARD,OTHERS
11534,It’s so romantic.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11535,"No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11536,"Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11537,"Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.",PENNY,PENNY
11538,"Yeah, not my point.",LEONARD,OTHERS
11539,Zack.,OTHERS,OTHERS
11540,"Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11541,"Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?",LEONARD,LEONARD
11542,What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11543,We could cut it into thirds.,RAJ,SHELDON
11544,"Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?",RAJ,SHELDON
11545,"Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.",LEONARD,OTHERS
11546,Sure.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11547,Why don’t you enlighten me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11548,Shall we toast?,RAJ,RAJ
11549,"No, it’s not Amy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11550,"Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11551,He takes the elf from off the shelf.,RAJ,RAJ
11552,"I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?",SHELDON,PENNY
11553,"Just go to work, he’ll be fine.",OTHERS,PENNY
11554,I was wrong. You can come back in.,OTHERS,PENNY
11555,"The thing is, we’re not….",SHELDON,RAJ
11556,It is to me; that’s the point.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11557,What do you think we should sell it for?,RAJ,PENNY
11558,"Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?",OTHERS,LEONARD
11559,"Apologise, for what?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11560,"Come on, really?",PENNY,SHELDON
11561,I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.,RAJ,SHELDON
11562,"You know, can I ask you a question?",PENNY,LEONARD
11563,"Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11564,"It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11565,I hate you.,SHELDON,PENNY
11566,"Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11567,"So, do you know who’s in there?",PENNY,SHELDON
11568,We cuddle. Final offer.,OTHERS,HOWARD
11569,No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.,SHELDON,PENNY
11570,You need a break?,PENNY,LEONARD
11571,"You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11572,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11573,"We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11574,"Oh, wait, stop that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11575,That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11576,"I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.",SHELDON,RAJ
11577,Which leads to…?,OTHERS,HOWARD
11578,"I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?",LEONARD,LEONARD
11579,The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.,PENNY,SHELDON
11580,"So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?",OTHERS,LEONARD
11581,Get out.,PENNY,SHELDON
11582,Go sit over there.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11583,"Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?",SHELDON,OTHERS
11584,Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?,OTHERS,PENNY
11585,"TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…",SHELDON,SHELDON
11586,Oh.,PENNY,PENNY
11587,"I got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11588,You went out and bought linen?,LEONARD,HOWARD
11589,It wasn’t cheap. It was free.,PENNY,HOWARD
11590,"Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11591,I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11592,He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11593,"Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.",PENNY,SHELDON
11594,"That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.",SHELDON,HOWARD
11595,Hey.,LEONARD,RAJ
11596,Migraines?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11597,Okay.,PENNY,LEONARD
11598,"Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.",LEONARD,HOWARD
11599,I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.,OTHERS,PENNY
11600,Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11601,"Broad shoulders, good hair.",OTHERS,PENNY
11602,A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.,SHELDON,RAJ
11603,"Oh, I see?",PENNY,PENNY
11604,That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.,LEONARD,PENNY
11605,"Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11606,It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11607,Mm-hmm.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11608,"Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11609,"Oh, you wanted me to pay.",PENNY,LEONARD
11610,"A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?",HOWARD,PENNY
11611,Howie.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11612,"Sheldon, get out of my way.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11613,I call tech support all the time.,OTHERS,SHELDON

11615,I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11616,"I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail.",HOWARD,HOWARD
11617,What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11618,"Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11619,"Well, he’s definitely not gay.",PENNY,SHELDON
11620,You did this?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11621,"Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11622,I saw it. It’s big.,LEONARD,PENNY
11623,Yeah?,HOWARD,LEONARD
11624,"Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.",PENNY,PENNY
11625,He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11626,"Honey, if you want one, just get one.",PENNY,LEONARD
11627,Kripke?,SHELDON,PENNY
11628,"Well, it’s been fun.",PENNY,LEONARD
11629,I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11630,Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.,PENNY,RAJ
11631,So you’ve just been lying to him?,OTHERS,LEONARD
11632,"Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11633,"Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11634,"So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?",PENNY,SHELDON
11635,Amy broke up with Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11636,Alright  I just hit my head.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11637,Can we go now?,PENNY,LEONARD
11638,Sure..,LEONARD,RAJ
11639,But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11640,And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11641,"What do you mean, every time you see her?",PENNY,PENNY
11642,"Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.",OTHERS,PENNY
11643,Where are you going?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11644,High-energy lasers.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11645,"Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11646,"Yeah, that felt nice.",OTHERS,HOWARD
11647,That would be fine.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11648,Wow.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11649,"Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.",RAJ,PENNY
11650,Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11651,More or less.,PENNY,SHELDON
11652,Sheldon.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11653,Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11654,"Well, he started it.",PENNY,HOWARD
11655,It’s getting beautiful again.,RAJ,SHELDON
11656,"Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11657,"No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11658,"Okay, fine, let’s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?",OTHERS,LEONARD
11659,"Hey, is Sheldon here?",PENNY,HOWARD
11660,I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11661,Of course.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11662,"Okay, Amy, your turn.",OTHERS,PENNY
11663,"Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.",SHELDON,OTHERS
11664,"Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.",PENNY,SHELDON
11665,Oh.,PENNY,LEONARD
11666,"Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11667,"No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that’s me. Never mind, it’s fine.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11668,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11669,"Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”",LEONARD,LEONARD
11670,"Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.",PENNY,LEONARD
11671,"Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11672,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?",OTHERS,OTHERS
11673,"Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11674,I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11675,Wow. Well done.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11676,O-o-o-oh!,HOWARD,PENNY
11677,"Hang on. I’m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11678,Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.,PENNY,SHELDON
11679,Nope.,PENNY,LEONARD
11680,We’re not quitting on Leonard.,HOWARD,PENNY
11681,"Nice to finally meet you, too.",PENNY,HOWARD
11682,Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.,HOWARD,HOWARD
11683,"Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?",LEONARD,SHELDON
11684,Why is there a hole here?,LEONARD,PENNY
11685,"Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?",PENNY,SHELDON
11686,Right.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11687,"Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.",PENNY,SHELDON
11688,"Okay, we’ll call that plan B.",RAJ,PENNY
11689,"Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11690,"I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11691,"Uh, I’m gonna go lie down.",LEONARD,PENNY
11692,"Hey, I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.",RAJ,LEONARD
11693,Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11694,"Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.",PENNY,SHELDON
11695,"I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11696,Who is it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11697,"Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.",PENNY,HOWARD
11698,"Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.",OTHERS,PENNY
11699,Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11700,I just don’t see how see can pull this off.,PENNY,SHELDON
11701,"All right, well, I want it in a church.",PENNY,SHELDON
11702,Can I have one more moment with Leonard?,SHELDON,HOWARD
11703,That’s not what I’m saying.,PENNY,LEONARD
11704,I’ll get the vodka.,OTHERS,OTHERS
11705,You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?,LEONARD,PENNY
11706,"No problem, Dr. Massimino.",HOWARD,HOWARD
11707,"Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11708,"I’m on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11709,I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.,SHELDON,HOWARD
11710,"It doesn’t matter. They’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it’s not offensive.",RAJ,SHELDON
11711,Are you here alone?,RAJ,HOWARD
11712,I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11713,In Sheldon’s spot.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11714,"Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?",SHELDON,SHELDON
11715,"Here’s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!",HOWARD,SHELDON
11716,How about we just have a little quiet time now?,PENNY,PENNY
11717,"Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.",PENNY,LEONARD
11718,"Why do you think I’d be like that? I get it, you’re taking one class. It’s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11719,"Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11720,What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11721,Is that really true?,OTHERS,LEONARD
11722,"Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11723,"It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11724,We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.,OTHERS,RAJ
11725,"You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.",RAJ,PENNY
11726,"Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11727,"Oh, yes. Yes, I am.",OTHERS,PENNY
11728,Reconstituted Thai food.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11729,"Well, we’ll get out of your hair.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11730,"Oh, hey.",PENNY,PENNY
11731,"Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11732,"Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.",RAJ,HOWARD
11733,"Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?",PENNY,SHELDON
11734,Why don’t you put your mother in a home?,RAJ,HOWARD
11735,"Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11736,Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?,OTHERS,PENNY
11737,No.,PENNY,SHELDON
11738,"Ugh, thanks a lot.",PENNY,LEONARD
11739,I’ll do it.,RAJ,LEONARD
11740,"Okay, now I see the giant squid head.",PENNY,PENNY
11741,What’s with the gloves?,RAJ,SHELDON
11742,No.,RAJ,PENNY
11743,"Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.",SHELDON,OTHERS
11744,What? You spent the night?,HOWARD,SHELDON
11745,Thank you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
11746,I wish I could believe you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11747,Who’s been paying for my coffee?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11748,"Hey, what’s going on?",OTHERS,OTHERS
11749,Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.,PENNY,SHELDON
11750,That’s a ridiculous rule.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11751,All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?,LEONARD,PENNY
11752,"Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.",SHELDON,OTHERS
11753,"This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11754,"Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.",RAJ,HOWARD
11755,Cheap science fiction?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11756,"Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.",SHELDON,PENNY
11757,"Yes, he’s new at the zoo.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11758,Dancing?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11759,Wheaton!,SHELDON,SHELDON
11760,"Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11761,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.,RAJ,HOWARD
11762,"Oh, just come in!",LEONARD,LEONARD
11763,Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?,SHELDON,LEONARD
11764,"Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him.",LEONARD,PENNY
11765,"Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.",PENNY,HOWARD
11766,"Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11767,"Well, no.",SHELDON,PENNY
11768,I don’t know. Foreplay?,LEONARD,OTHERS
11769,I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11770,No.,LEONARD,OTHERS
11771,"I told you, no.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11772,That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.,SHELDON,SHELDON
11773,"All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.",HOWARD,PENNY
11774,So what are you kids up to?,HOWARD,SHELDON
11775,Yes.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11776,"Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11777,"So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?",SHELDON,SHELDON
11778,Where do you think I would take you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
11779,"Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.",OTHERS,HOWARD
11780,You threw up?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11781,"Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?",PENNY,SHELDON
11782,"Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11783,It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.,HOWARD,HOWARD
11784,Sheldon.,OTHERS,RAJ
11785,"Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?",RAJ,SHELDON
11786,"Please let it go, Sheldon.",LEONARD,RAJ
11787,I think a boy likes me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11788,"Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.",OTHERS,PENNY
11789,"Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11790,Don’t worry about it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11791,"Well, you are.",OTHERS,PENNY
11792,Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11793,"I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.",PENNY,PENNY
11794,"It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.",PENNY,HOWARD
11795,Did something good happen?,OTHERS,PENNY
11796,"Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?",SHELDON,LEONARD
11797,"Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?",HOWARD,SHELDON
11798,I did. It’s all outdated or disproved.,HOWARD,PENNY
11799,I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11800,"Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11801,I lived with her to save money.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11802,Great.,RAJ,SHELDON
11803,"You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11804,I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?,SHELDON,SHELDON
11805,"Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11806,Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.,OTHERS,LEONARD
11807,Okay. Leonard: Cool.,PENNY,LEONARD
11808,"You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?",RAJ,SHELDON
11809,Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11810,"You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.",RAJ,RAJ
11811,"Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11812,Seconded.,OTHERS,HOWARD
11813,I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11814,"Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.",LEONARD,PENNY
11815,"Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick before?",PENNY,HOWARD
11816,"Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?",OTHERS,SHELDON
11817,I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.,OTHERS,PENNY
11818,"Well, for Penny it’s dancing night.",PENNY,OTHERS
11819,"Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.",RAJ,SHELDON
11820,"God, I love you. I love you so much.",LEONARD,PENNY
11821,You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.,RAJ,LEONARD
11822,Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11823,"Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.",PENNY,LEONARD
11824,"Appreciate that, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11825,"Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.",RAJ,SHELDON
11826,Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
11827,"Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11828,"Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I’m tired, I’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who’s with me?",PENNY,PENNY
11829,"Come on, let’s go.",LEONARD,LEONARD
11830,Make yourself comfortable.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11831,I know.,PENNY,HOWARD
11832,Come in! Hurry!,PENNY,LEONARD
11833,"If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11834,"Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?",LEONARD,HOWARD
11835,"Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.",OTHERS,OTHERS
11836,"Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.",PENNY,PENNY
11837,Perfect timing. Food’s ready.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11838,"Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I’m here, I’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.",PENNY,LEONARD
11839,I thought you might.,HOWARD,LEONARD
11840,How early are we?,PENNY,SHELDON
11841,Yeah.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11842,Hello.,SHELDON,OTHERS
11843,"Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.",HOWARD,SHELDON
11844,"Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11845,"That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met.",SHELDON,HOWARD
11846,"Okay, I didn’t know.",PENNY,PENNY
11847,I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.,SHELDON,PENNY
11848,"I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11849,"My room, of course.",SHELDON,PENNY
11850,"Of course not. I mean, he’s your brother.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11851,That better be Tootsie Rolls you’re throwing at me!,OTHERS,PENNY
11852,It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.,HOWARD,SHELDON
11853,"For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
11854,That’s the only logical inference.,RAJ,LEONARD
11855,"Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.",SHELDON,PENNY
11856,Mortal enemy?,OTHERS,SHELDON
11857,"Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.",OTHERS,OTHERS
11858,I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.,OTHERS,SHELDON
11859,"Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.",SHELDON,SHELDON
11860,"Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11861,"Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.",SHELDON,HOWARD
11862,"Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.",RAJ,LEONARD
11863,I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11864,Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?,OTHERS,PENNY
11865,"Yeah, my bikini region is fine.",PENNY,LEONARD
11866,Okay.,SHELDON,OTHERS
11867,"No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.",SHELDON,PENNY
11868,Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.,SHELDON,PENNY
11869,Well.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11870,"Hello? I… Oh, I don’t think so. I am so done with Twitter.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11871,"Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.",PENNY,HOWARD
11872,"Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.",SHELDON,PENNY
11873,So you’ll think about it?,HOWARD,PENNY
11874,Congratulations.,LEONARD,SHELDON
11875,Well answer it. I want to hear.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11876,"And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him.",RAJ,LEONARD
11877,"Yeah, sure.",LEONARD,SHELDON
11878,"Okay, so no Bernadette.",OTHERS,LEONARD
11879,He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.,LEONARD,LEONARD
11880,"Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.",OTHERS,PENNY
11881,We had a difference of opinion.,SHELDON,PENNY
11882,"So, um, should I get under the covers with you?",OTHERS,LEONARD
11883,"No, it’s only if you’ve done it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11884,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.,LEONARD,HOWARD
11885,"I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea.",RAJ,SHELDON
11886,"Hey, thanks.",PENNY,SHELDON
11887,"Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.",OTHERS,OTHERS
11888,I’ll miss you more.,OTHERS,PENNY
11889,You tricked me. You didn’t say one.,SHELDON,LEONARD
11890,What?,OTHERS,RAJ
11891,You know exactly what I’m talking about.,LEONARD,RAJ
11892,"I can’t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.",HOWARD,LEONARD
11893,Yes.,PENNY,SHELDON
11894,"Well, I got to run. The panel’s tomorrow morning. It’s called, Remembering Snow: A Look Back.",OTHERS,SHELDON
11895,There she goes.,OTHERS,SHELDON

12047,Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?,SHELDON,SHELDON
12048,"No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12049,"Um, Randall’s in between jobs.",OTHERS,LEONARD

12053,"Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?",PENNY,SHELDON
12054,"Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.",RAJ,HOWARD
12055,I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.,SHELDON,LEONARD
12056,"It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12057,"But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.",HOWARD,SHELDON
12058,Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?,OTHERS,HOWARD
12059,At the hands of those teenagers.,SHELDON,OTHERS
12060,Good. I’m glad.,SHELDON,SHELDON

12063,Is that a dog?,SHELDON,HOWARD

12071,"Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something.",LEONARD,HOWARD
12072,"Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?",OTHERS,SHELDON
12073,"I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?",RAJ,LEONARD
12074,There’s a draft on my neck over here.,SHELDON,PENNY
12075,Why are you up?,SHELDON,HOWARD

12082,Straightening up.,SHELDON,LEONARD

12087,But that’s my room.,SHELDON,HOWARD
12088,"Hey, where you been?",OTHERS,HOWARD
12089,She’s right. That’s reasonable.,PENNY,LEONARD
12090,"Well, hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.",HOWARD,LEONARD
12091,I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.,SHELDON,PENNY

12101,Do you need help getting out?,HOWARD,SHELDON
12102,"Yeah, yeah, a little.",RAJ,LEONARD
12103,How about that.,LEONARD,OTHERS
12104,"And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.",HOWARD,LEONARD
12105,"He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…",LEONARD,PENNY
12106,"Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles,  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.",SHELDON,HOWARD
12107,Is that a big deal?,LEONARD,SHELDON
12108,"I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.",RAJ,SHELDON
12109,"Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?",HOWARD,SHELDON
12110,It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?,RAJ,SHELDON

Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!",LEONARD,PENNY

12131,Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?,HOWARD,SHELDON
12132,So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?,RAJ,HOWARD
12133,"Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.",PENNY,LEONARD
12134,"Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.",SHELDON,PENNY
12135,"Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12136,Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?,LEONARD,SHELDON
12137,"Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.",RAJ,SHELDON
12138,What is your problem?,SHELDON,PENNY
12139,What happened to your scrambled egg research?,LEONARD,LEONARD
12140,The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.,SHELDON,SHELDON

12142,That’s so amazing.,RAJ,PENNY

12150,What’s AFK?,PENNY,LEONARD
12151,Never mind.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12152,"Incredible. Sheldon, I didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.",OTHERS,SHELDON

The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.  There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,",SHELDON,LEONARD

12191,"Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12192,That’s what I said.,OTHERS,SHELDON

12211,Now I feel a little gross.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12212,"Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.",LEONARD,PENNY

12215,Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?,OTHERS,SHELDON

12227,It’s just not a good time.,LEONARD,PENNY
12228,You’re right.,HOWARD,PENNY
12229,"Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12230,I can’t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.,HOWARD,LEONARD
12231,Why do you keep assuming it was me?,HOWARD,PENNY
12232,"You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend.",PENNY,LEONARD

12244,How would you say it?,PENNY,LEONARD
12245,"Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop, just slow down, I’ll jump out.",LEONARD,LEONARD

12703,It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.,SHELDON,SHELDON
12704,Don’t you like Amy?,SHELDON,PENNY
12705,"I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.",PENNY,LEONARD
12706,Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?,LEONARD,SHELDON
12707,"Yes, you are a super weaner.",LEONARD,LEONARD
12708,Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.,OTHERS,LEONARD
12709,"Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.",PENNY,LEONARD
12710,"Yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much.",SHELDON,HOWARD
12711,Screw that.,PENNY,LEONARD
12712,"– Priya, can I come in?",LEONARD,SHELDON
12713,"Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.",OTHERS,HOWARD
12714,"Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.",PENNY,SHELDON
12715,"Hey, how’d it go?",LEONARD,PENNY
12716,I reject it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
12717,"No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.",PENNY,HOWARD
12718,Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.,LEONARD,SHELDON
12719,"Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
12720,"Ah, it’s just like he’s here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12721,"No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?",SHELDON,OTHERS
12722,She got the way to groove me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12723,"Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee.",SHELDON,HOWARD
12724,"Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12725,How do you know?,RAJ,PENNY
12726,Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?,HOWARD,HOWARD
12727,"Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?",RAJ,SHELDON
12728,Then where’s the coin?,OTHERS,SHELDON
12729,"Thanks, Ma.",HOWARD,SHELDON
12730,"Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in.",OTHERS,PENNY
12731,My date would’ve had to clean that up.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12732,Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
12733,A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.,HOWARD,PENNY
12734,Not if you believe his doctors.,LEONARD,LEONARD
12735,Just a sec.  Too much?,PENNY,PENNY
12736,Why are you still here?,OTHERS,PENNY
12737,You’re right. Cheers.,OTHERS,LEONARD
12738,"As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.",SHELDON,PENNY
12739,"No, it’s not. Howard, tell them.",RAJ,OTHERS
12740,"Man, he’s going to be blindsided.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12741,"You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.",RAJ,SHELDON
12742,"You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.",HOWARD,PENNY
12743,"Oh, you seem extra happy.",PENNY,LEONARD
12744,"Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12745,Oh.,PENNY,HOWARD
12746,"Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?",LEONARD,SHELDON
12747,Probably not.,LEONARD,SHELDON
12748,It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.,RAJ,PENNY
12749,"Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.",SHELDON,HOWARD
12750,"Uh, do you mind if I sit?",LEONARD,SHELDON
12751,"As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12752,"Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.",RAJ,SHELDON
12753,I don’t know.,PENNY,LEONARD
12754,"Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?",SHELDON,OTHERS
12755,"So, you think she’ll be single soon?",OTHERS,PENNY
12756,"Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12757,What the frak?,HOWARD,OTHERS
12758,And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?,RAJ,SHELDON
12759,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?",LEONARD,SHELDON
12760,"Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…",LEONARD,SHELDON
12761,That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.,LEONARD,PENNY
12762,"The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12763,"Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.",LEONARD,PENNY
12764,"Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.",RAJ,SHELDON
12765,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
12766,"Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12767,"Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.",SHELDON,PENNY
12768,That’s cute.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12769,You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.,RAJ,LEONARD
12770,"Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12771,"Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!",LEONARD,SHELDON
12772,"So, how do you wanna do this?",LEONARD,LEONARD
12773,"Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.",LEONARD,OTHERS
12774,What are you doing?,SHELDON,PENNY
12775,"I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12776,Do you prefer ointment or cream?,SHELDON,LEONARD
12777,"Oh, for God’s sake, just come to the play.",PENNY,OTHERS
12778,"Sleep well, my friend.",SHELDON,HOWARD
12779,"To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon.",LEONARD,PENNY
12780,"You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird.",HOWARD,PENNY
12781,Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?,PENNY,HOWARD
12782,"Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?",PENNY,PENNY
12783,"Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?",HOWARD,LEONARD
12784,How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.,OTHERS,LEONARD
12785,Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back.,LEONARD,LEONARD
12786,"Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.",PENNY,PENNY
12787,"Yeah, what are we eating?",HOWARD,HOWARD
12788,"Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.",SHELDON,RAJ
12789,"Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!",SHELDON,PENNY
12790,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
12791,"Nuts to that, I’m going to Comic-Con.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12792,"Well, if you want, you can come with me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12793,I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.,SHELDON,OTHERS
12794,You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
12795,How about donating some of your clothes?,OTHERS,PENNY
12796,"Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12797,"I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12798,"Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?",PENNY,HOWARD
12799,Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.,RAJ,LEONARD
12800,"Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.",HOWARD,PENNY
12801,How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.,HOWARD,OTHERS
12802,"Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12803,"I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12804,I really don’t think we do tha…,HOWARD,RAJ
12805,Great. And where are you?,HOWARD,SHELDON
12806,That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.,SHELDON,PENNY
12807,I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.,OTHERS,LEONARD
12808,"Oh, boy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12809,What are you doing?,LEONARD,PENNY
12810,"Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.",PENNY,SHELDON
12811,I wouldn’t be so sure about that.,PENNY,PENNY
12812,"I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.",RAJ,RAJ
12813,You just did.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12814,What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?,PENNY,HOWARD
12815,That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.,SHELDON,LEONARD
12816,That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.,SHELDON,HOWARD
12817,It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.,SHELDON,LEONARD
12818,That’s kind of creepy.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12819,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?,SHELDON,SHELDON
12820,I’m not an alcoholic.,RAJ,HOWARD
12821,"Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.",LEONARD,LEONARD
12822,"Oh. Howie, be serious.",OTHERS,OTHERS
12823,"I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.",SHELDON,RAJ
12824,That’s your system?,LEONARD,HOWARD
12825,"You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?",LEONARD,RAJ
12826,"Oh, that is so thoughtful.",PENNY,LEONARD
12827,"I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12828,"Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.",SHELDON,OTHERS
12829,Is the Wi-Fi working for you?,LEONARD,LEONARD
12830,"Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12831,Um…,LEONARD,SHELDON
12832,"It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12833,"Well, the prices have been coming down.",HOWARD,SHELDON
12834,"You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?",SHELDON,RAJ
12835,"You hung in there, though.",PENNY,SHELDON
12836,"I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?",PENNY,LEONARD
12837,"Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.",HOWARD,SHELDON
12838,I’m back.,SHELDON,PENNY
12839,How about soup?,RAJ,PENNY
12840,Your what?,PENNY,SHELDON
12841,Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.,SHELDON,LEONARD
12842,"Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12843,"Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12844,"If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12845,"Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.",SHELDON,PENNY
12846,Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?,PENNY,LEONARD
12847,"Geez, what a fun couple.",PENNY,LEONARD
12848,"Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.",RAJ,PENNY
12849,Way ahead of you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
12850,Barely knew him.,SHELDON,RAJ
12851,"Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?",SHELDON,SHELDON
12852,Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.,LEONARD,SHELDON
12853,See? This is the right thing for her. Let’s all just go to work.,OTHERS,RAJ
12854,Sheldon.,OTHERS,OTHERS
12855,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
12856,Did you sign this?,RAJ,PENNY
12857,"Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12858,"Well, promise you won’t make fun of me.",PENNY,SHELDON
12859,"That’s it. All of you, in my office now!",OTHERS,OTHERS
12860,"You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.",RAJ,PENNY
12861,"Oh. Thank you, Raj.",OTHERS,LEONARD
12862,"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.",RAJ,PENNY
12863,"Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.",RAJ,SHELDON
12864,Ancient Greece?,PENNY,SHELDON
12865,"Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’ve been between them for the last ten years.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12866,And we agreed to never speak of it again.,HOWARD,HOWARD
12867,"Okay, bye-bye.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12868,I’m not jealous.,LEONARD,HOWARD
12869,"Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?",OTHERS,RAJ
12870,"As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12871,"Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.",RAJ,SHELDON
12872,Yep.,PENNY,SHELDON
12873,"I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.",LEONARD,LEONARD
12874,Sounds like the night we had coitus.,OTHERS,PENNY
12875,"If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.",HOWARD,RAJ
12876,All right. There’s a female.,SHELDON,PENNY
12877,"Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.",HOWARD,LEONARD
12878,She did.,SHELDON,SHELDON
12879,Don’t be like that.,PENNY,LEONARD
12880,You’re making it a big deal.,PENNY,LEONARD
12881,I… uh…,LEONARD,SHELDON
12882,Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?,RAJ,LEONARD
12883,"Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12884,"Yeah, of course, why?",LEONARD,SHELDON
12885,See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.,OTHERS,LEONARD
12886,"Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.",SHELDON,LEONARD
12887,"Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?",HOWARD,LEONARD
12888,"Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12889,"Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12890,"Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.",RAJ,SHELDON
12891,You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?,SHELDON,SHELDON
12892,"Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.",PENNY,SHELDON
12893,"So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
12894,"And, of course, Mom.",LEONARD,SHELDON
12895,"Well, of course. There’s no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.",OTHERS,PENNY
12896,What are you talking about?,RAJ,SHELDON
12897,"Hi, Stuart.",OTHERS,PENNY
12898,It’s nice that you called them esteemed.,LEONARD,SHELDON

12903,"Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?",PENNY,SHELDON
12904,"So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up.",PENNY,LEONARD
12905,"Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?",OTHERS,LEONARD

12907,"I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one.",PENNY,RAJ
12908,"Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.",PENNY,SHELDON
12909,They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.,RAJ,PENNY
12910,"Oh, me.",OTHERS,LEONARD
12911,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.",SHELDON,LEONARD

12913,We can’t afford to lose any more time.,LEONARD,LEONARD
12914,"Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.",PENNY,SHELDON

12916,There you go.,PENNY,SHELDON
12917,"Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question.",PENNY,LEONARD
12918,How was your football party?,LEONARD,SHELDON

12925,"Yeah, well, I have street smarts.",PENNY,RAJ
12926,How do you know that?,RAJ,SHELDON

12928,Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.,LEONARD,SHELDON

12971,Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.,OTHERS,PENNY
12972,"Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.",OTHERS,PENNY

12979,Not particularly.,OTHERS,HOWARD
12980,"I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12981,"All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.",LEONARD,PENNY
12982,Sheldon’s in jail?,LEONARD,LEONARD
12983,"They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions.",RAJ,SHELDON
12984,Is that friend Wolowitz?,PENNY,SHELDON
12985,"Slick, huh?",SHELDON,OTHERS
12986,"While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.",SHELDON,PENNY
12987,I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.,SHELDON,SHELDON
12988,Troll master.,HOWARD,RAJ
12989,"Then what was oh, boy?",LEONARD,OTHERS
12990,Sheldon?,OTHERS,PENNY
12991,"Excuse me, but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here.",RAJ,LEONARD
12992,"I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.",SHELDON,PENNY
12993,What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?,HOWARD,SHELDON
12994,"Let’s see. You’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12995,And I have food here. You said you were going to call.,LEONARD,SHELDON
12996,"Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.",OTHERS,SHELDON
12997,"Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.",SHELDON,SHELDON
12998,I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.,SHELDON,LEONARD
12999,Hello?,RAJ,OTHERS
13000,"See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13001,"Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.",LEONARD,OTHERS
13002,"I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13003,No.,SHELDON,HOWARD
13004,"Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…",SHELDON,SHELDON
13005,"You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13006,You got one for good luck.  I’ll get it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13007,"So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13008,"You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.",PENNY,LEONARD
13009,I’m sure she did.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13010,"Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.",PENNY,PENNY
13011,Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.,LEONARD,RAJ
13012,Hu.. what?,PENNY,SHELDON
13013,What are you talking about?,LEONARD,LEONARD
13014,"That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?",PENNY,LEONARD
13015,How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13016,"Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.",OTHERS,HOWARD
13017,"Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?",PENNY,SHELDON
13018,"I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life.",RAJ,SHELDON
13019,"A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.",SHELDON,RAJ
13020,I didn’t know you were interested in dating.,OTHERS,PENNY

13022,"Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13023,Yes?  Did you forget your key?,SHELDON,LEONARD
13024,"By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13025,It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13026,What is it?,SHELDON,HOWARD
13027,"No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13028,"Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works.",HOWARD,LEONARD
13029,We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13030,"I love you, too. We’re good.",RAJ,RAJ
13031,Did Kathy Geiger laugh?,OTHERS,LEONARD
13032,"Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13033,You’re engaged to my friend.,PENNY,PENNY
13034,All right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13035,Howard?,OTHERS,LEONARD
13036,She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13037,"And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.",RAJ,PENNY
13038,What are you doing in my bedroom?,PENNY,LEONARD
13039,"All right. Well, tell him Amy called.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13040,Why do you get to pick?,HOWARD,SHELDON
13041,"Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There’s no need to call an idea stupid.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13042,"And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there.",RAJ,HOWARD
13043,"Ah, we’ll miss you, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13044,"All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?",HOWARD,SHELDON
13045,"Excuse me, could you help us out?",LEONARD,PENNY
13046,"Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.",SHELDON,RAJ
13047,I love it.,PENNY,SHELDON
13048,But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.,PENNY,LEONARD
13049,"Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.",RAJ,SHELDON
13050,Leave me alone.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13051,"I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13052,"Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…",SHELDON,PENNY
13053,"Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13054,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab.",LEONARD,SHELDON

13056,Okay. Good.,PENNY,HOWARD

13058,"Uh, wish we had a skimmer.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13059,"Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.",PENNY,SHELDON

13064,"Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.",RAJ,RAJ
13065,"Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it’s important.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13066,: This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.,SHELDON,PENNY
13067,"Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.",LEONARD,RAJ
13068,You’re just gonna leave him here?,PENNY,PENNY
13069,How many times have I asked you not to do that?,LEONARD,OTHERS
13070,"Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?",LEONARD,SHELDON
13071,I’m fine.,SHELDON,PENNY
13072,"You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13073,Any ideas Raj?,PENNY,SHELDON
13074,"Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.",HOWARD,PENNY
13075,"It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.",LEONARD,PENNY
13076,"Okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.",PENNY,LEONARD

13085,Thank you.,PENNY,OTHERS
13086,In here.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13087,This is an interesting way to stay out of it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13088,"Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.",SHELDON,OTHERS
13089,"Well, now I know.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13090,"Papa, please don’t start.",RAJ,LEONARD

13094,Who?,OTHERS,PENNY
13095,"Do something, Batman.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13096,"Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?",SHELDON,SHELDON
13097,"I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13098,I am.,HOWARD,LEONARD

13103,I think we’re safe.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13104,He is the only person we know with actual muscles.,HOWARD,PENNY
13105,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment.",LEONARD,RAJ
13106,"Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13107,"No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?",HOWARD,SHELDON
13108,How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?,HOWARD,RAJ

13117,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
13118,"Hey, what’s up?",LEONARD,SHELDON
13119,"To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.",SHELDON,HOWARD
13120,Xbox.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13121,Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?,LEONARD,SHELDON
13122,"Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?",PENNY,HOWARD
13123,So I’ll say maybe.,OTHERS,PENNY
13124,"And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…",HOWARD,RAJ
13125,"Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?",SHELDON,SHELDON
13126,And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.,PENNY,LEONARD
13127,Oh no.,LEONARD,LEONARD

13130,"Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.",LEONARD,SHELDON

13133,What? Where did you get 171 men?,PENNY,HOWARD
13134,"Thank you, Rajesh.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13135,Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13136,This is not over.,RAJ,SHELDON
13137,What’s taking so long?,PENNY,OTHERS
13138,"If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam.",HOWARD,RAJ
13139,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?,LEONARD,RAJ

13141,"If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.",LEONARD,PENNY

13163,"Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13164,"I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good.",HOWARD,PENNY

13289,"Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13290,The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.,SHELDON,HOWARD

13501,"All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.",PENNY,SHELDON
13502,And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13503,"Whatever it is, I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong.",RAJ,HOWARD
13504,He’s a righty.,HOWARD,RAJ
13505,What the hell? What? She’s not working late.,PENNY,SHELDON
13506,What are we going to do?,LEONARD,HOWARD

13509,I agree.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13510,"Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13511,"This time, it’s your fault.",LEONARD,PENNY
13512,"It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13513,Hi.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13514,"Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.",SHELDON,HOWARD
13515,No?,LEONARD,PENNY
13516,"Thank you, darling.",RAJ,LEONARD
13517,We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.,LEONARD,LEONARD

13521,Und ich bin eine pretzel!,OTHERS,SHELDON
13522,"Not this time, I promise.",HOWARD,SHELDON
13523,"Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13524,"Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now.",RAJ,SHELDON
13525,And that’s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13526,I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13527,Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13528,Uh-huh.,PENNY,SHELDON
13529,Watching your old friend?,OTHERS,LEONARD
13530,I’m the one who thought of it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13531,Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13532,She’s not my girlfriend.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13533,I don’t know. I just got back.,SHELDON,PENNY
13534,"Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13535,You ready to go?,LEONARD,PENNY
13536,Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13537,Thanks.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13538,Yes!,HOWARD,LEONARD
13539,But what are you looking for?,HOWARD,PENNY
13540,Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.,SHELDON,RAJ
13541,Hey.,OTHERS,HOWARD
13542,Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?,HOWARD,SHELDON
13543,"What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13544,Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?,PENNY,SHELDON
13545,I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.,SHELDON,PENNY
13546,"Ooh, I love English accents.",OTHERS,HOWARD
13547,"You started it, we just piled on.",HOWARD,SHELDON
13548,I’ll take the bullet.,HOWARD,SHELDON

13551,"Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.",RAJ,SHELDON
13552,"Oh, my God. What personal habits?",PENNY,OTHERS
13553,How much beer have you had?,PENNY,PENNY
13554,"Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.",PENNY,LEONARD
13555,That’s an odd mix of people.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13556,"Oh, actually, I would.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13557,It’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you’ve done.,OTHERS,PENNY
13558,"Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture.",PENNY,PENNY
13559,"Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13560,I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13561,"Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?",HOWARD,OTHERS
13562,I see a problem.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13563,"Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.",HOWARD,SHELDON
13564,"Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.",RAJ,SHELDON
13565,I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13566,Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?,RAJ,PENNY
13567,"Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?",RAJ,HOWARD
13568,I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.,PENNY,LEONARD
13569,Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13570,"You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13571,"That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?",SHELDON,LEONARD
13572,"Oh, good one.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13573,This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.,RAJ,RAJ
13574,That was a lot of puppies.,SHELDON,PENNY
13575,We’re not living together.,LEONARD,PENNY
13576,And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13577,I’m so glad you like it.,OTHERS,PENNY
13578,"Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.",LEONARD,LEONARD

13581,"Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.",RAJ,LEONARD
13582,Ew.,PENNY,LEONARD
13583,"Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13584,Oh-hom yeah.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13585,One sec. Hey. Sorry.,LEONARD,RAJ
13586,"Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13587,"Sheldon, dinner’s here.",LEONARD,PENNY
13588,Which is stronger than ever.,OTHERS,RAJ
13589,It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.,SHELDON,OTHERS
13590,Okay. Go ahead.,SHELDON,HOWARD
13591,No. See what I did there? I turned it around.,RAJ,SHELDON
13592,That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.,LEONARD,PENNY
13593,"Hi. Penny, right?",OTHERS,LEONARD
13594,It was us the whole time.,OTHERS,HOWARD
13595,"Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13596,I’m not. No offence.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13597,"I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13598,"Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13599,"Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?",HOWARD,SHELDON
13600,All right.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13601,"I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13602,"Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?",LEONARD,PENNY
13603,"Alright, that’s it.",HOWARD,PENNY
13604,We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?,PENNY,PENNY
13605,"Well, so do I, but they’ll never let us.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13606,No.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13607,Are you gonna break up with him?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13608,What did I do?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13609,"Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?",SHELDON,RAJ
13610,"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.",SHELDON,PENNY
13611,"Well, whatever, why don’t you go hop off on a quest, I’m talking to Penny here.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13612,I don’t understand.,RAJ,LEONARD
13613,"So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13614,Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13615,Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.,LEONARD,HOWARD
13616,"So, Penny, when’s the new job start?",HOWARD,SHELDON
13617,Are you Jewish?,HOWARD,OTHERS
13618,"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?",SHELDON,OTHERS
13619,"You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?",RAJ,SHELDON
13620,Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13621,And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?,SHELDON,SHELDON
13622,So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?,LEONARD,SHELDON
13623,"Oh, thank you, Penny.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13624,"Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. I don’t want tea.",PENNY,SHELDON
13625,"Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.",HOWARD,SHELDON
13626,Sure.,LEONARD,PENNY
13627,They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13628,Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?,HOWARD,LEONARD
13629,"It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.",OTHERS,HOWARD
13630,They asked me to come in.,LEONARD,PENNY
13631,Seriously?,OTHERS,PENNY
13632,I’m sorry. What was I thinking?,PENNY,SHELDON
13633,"Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13634,"They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13635,Hang on.,RAJ,SHELDON
13636,"Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.",SHELDON,PENNY
13637,"Oh, nice.",PENNY,HOWARD
13638,No. That’s the sad part.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13639,"And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.",RAJ,SHELDON
13640,Who’s Radiohead?,PENNY,HOWARD
13641,"Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.",RAJ,LEONARD
13642,"First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.",HOWARD,LEONARD
13643,"Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.",PENNY,LEONARD
13644,Have you met Bernadette’s parents?,LEONARD,PENNY
13645,What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.,OTHERS,OTHERS
13646,"I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13647,Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.,SHELDON,OTHERS
13648,What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?,RAJ,SHELDON
13649,"Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.",HOWARD,HOWARD
13650,"Your questionnaire, very disappointing.",SHELDON,RAJ
13651,Not even strawberry Quik?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13652,I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?,HOWARD,LEONARD
13653,That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.,RAJ,PENNY
13654,Yeah.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13655,"Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?",PENNY,HOWARD
13656,Well?,SHELDON,SHELDON
13657,"I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.",HOWARD,SHELDON
13658,"Well, do you really think I have a shot?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13659,What are you doing?,SHELDON,SHELDON
13660,"Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.",SHELDON,PENNY
13661,And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13662,"Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it’s not.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13663,"Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13664,"Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?",SHELDON,SHELDON
13665,"So, how’s your experiment going?",OTHERS,SHELDON
13666,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13667,Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.,PENNY,SHELDON
13668,"Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
13669,You’re so full of it.,RAJ,PENNY

13673,"Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13674,And you picked me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13675,Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13676,Howard’s a complete and total ass.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13677,But what if we can’t?,SHELDON,LEONARD
13678,"Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13679,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13680,"Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13681,Fine.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13682,"Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.",RAJ,SHELDON
13683,"I’m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.",PENNY,LEONARD
13684,"I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13685,I don’t think so. Why?,LEONARD,SHELDON

13687,Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!,SHELDON,LEONARD
13688,That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13689,"Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.",SHELDON,PENNY
13690,I wonder how much she spent on this.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13691,And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13692,Okay. Here goes.,PENNY,LEONARD

13694,Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13695,Really?,PENNY,SHELDON
13696,You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.,RAJ,HOWARD
13697,"I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.",SHELDON,PENNY
13698,"No, Ma!",HOWARD,PENNY
13699,I don’t get it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13700,What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13701,"Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13702,No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13703,"No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13704,"Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13705,Rain check.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13706,"Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.",RAJ,PENNY
13707,Just going to skip over that insult.,PENNY,LEONARD

13711,"No, Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13712,"Oh, Raj, look at you!",PENNY,PENNY
13713,"Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?",SHELDON,LEONARD
13714,We can drive there.,RAJ,SHELDON
13715,What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13716,"I don’t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don’t know much about<i> Doctor Who.",OTHERS,PENNY
13717,"Oh, thank you.",PENNY,SHELDON
13718,What’s yours?,PENNY,SHELDON
13719,"Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.",SHELDON,RAJ

13722,How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?,LEONARD,LEONARD
13723,That’s Summer Glau.,HOWARD,SHELDON

13730,Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.,OTHERS,PENNY

13742,"Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13743,It’s ridiculous.,PENNY,HOWARD
13744,"Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.",SHELDON,OTHERS
13745,No.,HOWARD,RAJ
13746,"You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

13760,"Come on, buddy, open up.",LEONARD,PENNY
13761,You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13762,"So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13763,"No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.",OTHERS,RAJ
13764,In which I am not an expert.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13765,"Um, is this getting weird?",HOWARD,LEONARD
13766,Why? I said I didn’t care.,LEONARD,PENNY
13767,"Well, should we, uh, head back up?",OTHERS,HOWARD
13768,"Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13769,"Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.",PENNY,LEONARD
13770,"No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.",PENNY,SHELDON
13771,I don’t wanna.,PENNY,OTHERS
13772,"It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?",LEONARD,SHELDON

13774,"Amy, look, I’m on a unicycle!",SHELDON,SHELDON
13775,What?,HOWARD,SHELDON
13776,Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.,SHELDON,HOWARD
13777,I would think he would know that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13778,The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet.  One minute. Sis  n.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13779,"Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad.",SHELDON,RAJ
13780,"Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13781,Huh?,SHELDON,SHELDON
13782,"Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13783,"Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.",HOWARD,PENNY
13784,Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.,SHELDON,SHELDON

13786,Why would you say that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
13787,"Hey, how was dinner?",PENNY,SHELDON
13788,"Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?",PENNY,LEONARD
13789,Do you make it with milk or water?,SHELDON,OTHERS
13790,I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13791,Fourteen and a half.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13792,"Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.",RAJ,PENNY
13793,"– Sorry, sorry.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13794,Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?,LEONARD,SHELDON
13795,"Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.",RAJ,OTHERS

13797,Thanks a lot.,PENNY,LEONARD
13798,Sorry.,RAJ,SHELDON
13799,"May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13800,Goth food.,RAJ,SHELDON
13801,Hallelujah.,HOWARD,PENNY
13802,"Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13803,There’s someone at my door.,SHELDON,PENNY
13804,How is that a drunk text?,OTHERS,LEONARD
13805,Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Bye.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13806,Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.,OTHERS,LEONARD

13808,"And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go.",PENNY,SHELDON
13809,"No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.",RAJ,LEONARD
13810,"My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.",SHELDON,PENNY
13811,"Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?",SHELDON,HOWARD
13812,No.,PENNY,PENNY
13813,"No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13814,"Well, where is he?",PENNY,PENNY
13815,William Shatner.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13816,"All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?",SHELDON,LEONARD
13817,What are you doing?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13818,"He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.",RAJ,SHELDON
13819,"Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13820,I was humiliated by yet another woman.,RAJ,SHELDON
13821,An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.,PENNY,LEONARD
13822,"Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about.",HOWARD,LEONARD
13823,"Oh, tell us.",PENNY,PENNY
13824,"Oh, dear Lord!",SHELDON,LEONARD
13825,"Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.",SHELDON,OTHERS
13826,And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!,SHELDON,SHELDON
13827,That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13828,Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13829,"Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.",PENNY,SHELDON
13830,"Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream.",HOWARD,LEONARD
13831,"Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!",RAJ,LEONARD
13832,"Oh, how is she?",OTHERS,LEONARD
13833,"Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13834,"This is my moment, dag nab it!",SHELDON,SHELDON
13835,Penny?,SHELDON,PENNY
13836,And she was my second cousin.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13837,"As a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13838,"Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.",LEONARD,PENNY
13839,I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13840,"I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13841,"I’ll, I’ll call for help.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13842,Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13843,Hi?,PENNY,RAJ
13844,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13845,Those are very wise words.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13846,"Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13847,Are they actually arguing about comic books?,RAJ,LEONARD
13848,Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13849,You should.,PENNY,HOWARD
13850,"So, which one do you think it is, matey?",LEONARD,HOWARD
13851,"Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.",SHELDON,RAJ

13856,"Hey, where’d you go?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13857,Get him out Leonard.,SHELDON,PENNY
13858,"Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I’ll just put them under my tree.",PENNY,LEONARD
13859,"Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13860,"Oh, Tesla.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13861,Never mind.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13862,"Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13863,Maybe there’s a third option.,SHELDON,PENNY
13864,Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.,PENNY,LEONARD
13865,"Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.",RAJ,PENNY
13866,I did?,PENNY,SHELDON
13867,"You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!",LEONARD,PENNY
13868,Other people would say “why not?”,LEONARD,LEONARD
13869,"Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?",LEONARD,OTHERS

13871,"Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13872,Putting it in my phone right now.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13873,Good. Don’t do it.,SHELDON,HOWARD
13874,"Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?",PENNY,PENNY
13875,"Penny, you’re up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13876,"Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.",OTHERS,SHELDON
13877,Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13878,"Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?",SHELDON,LEONARD
13879,Of course not.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13880,"Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13881,"All right, say hello to your mother for me.",SHELDON,RAJ
13882,"You’re right, the party’s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.",HOWARD,SHELDON
13883,"We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?",HOWARD,SHELDON
13884,It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.,SHELDON,HOWARD
13885,But I still need to use the bathroom.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13886,"Think it through, Leonard.",PENNY,LEONARD
13887,Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.,HOWARD,LEONARD
13888,"I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13889,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13890,The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.,HOWARD,SHELDON
13891,I saw you having naked sex.,SHELDON,LEONARD
13892,"I know, I’m familiar with you.",LEONARD,PENNY
13893,"Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?",PENNY,LEONARD
13894,That’s a lousy conversation starter.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13895,I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?,PENNY,PENNY
13896,"Thank you, but I’m not really sure.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13897,"Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?",HOWARD,PENNY
13898,"Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?",HOWARD,HOWARD
13899,"Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.",OTHERS,PENNY
13900,Then make soup.,LEONARD,PENNY
13901,Thank you.,PENNY,LEONARD
13902,What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.,RAJ,LEONARD
13903,Or in the closet. We can decide later.,OTHERS,LEONARD
13904,"Uh, she’s seeing me.",RAJ,HOWARD
13905,Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?,OTHERS,LEONARD
13906,"Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.",LEONARD,PENNY
13907,"Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.",PENNY,SHELDON
13908,It’s going to be okay.,RAJ,PENNY
13909,"It is, isn’t it?",PENNY,LEONARD
13910,Something his mother taught him.,LEONARD,PENNY
13911,Thank you.,PENNY,PENNY
13912,"Oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you.",LEONARD,OTHERS

13914,Like you’re doing right now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13915,I don’t have a loofah.,LEONARD,PENNY
13916,How was your prom? Did you go?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13917,"Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.",RAJ,SHELDON
13918,"It is, isn’t it?",OTHERS,SHELDON
13919,Kinda.,OTHERS,RAJ
13920,"Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?",SHELDON,LEONARD
13921,Coming.,SHELDON,PENNY
13922,It’s not about that.,RAJ,RAJ
13923,I’ll start again.,LEONARD,OTHERS
13924,"Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?",OTHERS,HOWARD
13925,"Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second.",RAJ,SHELDON
13926,Your head goes on the other end.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13927,"Oh, you did, didn’t you?",PENNY,LEONARD
13928,One at a time.  What was that?,SHELDON,PENNY
13929,Who is it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
13930,"Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.",PENNY,SHELDON
13931,"Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?",PENNY,PENNY
13932,"So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.",LEONARD,SHELDON
13933,"Well, hello to you, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13934,"Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.",SHELDON,HOWARD
13935,"Okay, now you’re just showing off.",SHELDON,LEONARD
13936,"This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13937,Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13938,"No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.",RAJ,SHELDON
13939,No.,OTHERS,PENNY
13940,And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13941,"I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…",HOWARD,HOWARD
13942,"Actually, yes. I do.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13943,No.,LEONARD,RAJ
13944,"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13945,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?",SHELDON,LEONARD
13946,But why are you here?,SHELDON,PENNY
13947,"You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.",RAJ,LEONARD
13948,"Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!",HOWARD,LEONARD
13949,"Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
13950,Really?,LEONARD,PENNY

13952,You should probably go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13953,"Oh, great. Do that.",LEONARD,OTHERS
13954,Which one?,PENNY,PENNY
13955,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?",SHELDON,SHELDON

13962,"Oh, my God, what did you do?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13963,"Who cares, as long as you pick me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13964,"Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.",RAJ,LEONARD
13965,Why would you do that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
13966,"Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13967,"Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous.",LEONARD,HOWARD
13968,"That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.",LEONARD,PENNY
13969,"I’m good, I’m good to go.",LEONARD,RAJ
13970,"Pretty cool about Howard, huh?",LEONARD,LEONARD
13971,Penny kissed me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13972,Please.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13973,I tried. She’s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake.,OTHERS,SHELDON
13974,"I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.",OTHERS,HOWARD
13975,"Well, hand it over so I can open it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
13976,"You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.",PENNY,SHELDON
13977,"Hmm, that’s weird.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13978,Where you’d never look.,OTHERS,RAJ
13979,"Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?",HOWARD,SHELDON
13980,What do you mean?,HOWARD,PENNY
13981,I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13982,I am looking at you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
13983,What? Why?,PENNY,PENNY
13984,"Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13985,"Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!",HOWARD,HOWARD
13986,You’re here.,SHELDON,PENNY
13987,"Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.",PENNY,LEONARD
13988,You were just humming.,LEONARD,SHELDON
13989,"Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.",PENNY,LEONARD
13990,"It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.",PENNY,LEONARD
13991,"Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.",PENNY,PENNY
13992,"And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.",OTHERS,LEONARD
13993,"I bought the first one, it didn’t fall.",RAJ,PENNY
13994,"I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.",SHELDON,SHELDON
13995,"Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?",LEONARD,HOWARD
13996,No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.,RAJ,LEONARD
13997,Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.,SHELDON,SHELDON
13998,"well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?",SHELDON,OTHERS
13999,No. Never.,HOWARD,LEONARD
14000,"Good night, Sheldon.",PENNY,OTHERS
14001,It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.,HOWARD,PENNY
14002,"Okay, I’ll think about it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14003,"Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?",PENNY,SHELDON
14004,In his tongue.,OTHERS,LEONARD

14006,"Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser.",PENNY,LEONARD
14007,"Oh, this is ridiculous. What?",PENNY,SHELDON
14008,Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14009,"Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.",OTHERS,OTHERS
14010,"Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14011,I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.,SHELDON,PENNY
14012,"You know, ’cause you’re so into science.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14013,You’re welcome. How’s your fish?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14014,What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14015,"Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?",OTHERS,PENNY
14016,It means doo-doo.,RAJ,SHELDON
14017,"What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?",LEONARD,SHELDON
14018,"Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14019,But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14020,"Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14021,"Good, ‘cos they don’t work.",HOWARD,HOWARD

14024,Hi.,PENNY,HOWARD
14025,Wolowitz?,SHELDON,LEONARD
14026,"Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?",SHELDON,HOWARD
14027,Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14028,That’s true. You are.,PENNY,SHELDON
14029,"Yeah, and you’re still eating our food.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14030,You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.,LEONARD,OTHERS
14031,I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.,SHELDON,LEONARD

14037,"So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?",SHELDON,LEONARD
14038,What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?,PENNY,LEONARD

14077,And what are you getting him back for?,LEONARD,PENNY

14079,I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?,RAJ,PENNY
14080,Where are my clothes?,PENNY,RAJ

14082,I thought we were getting breakfast before work.,LEONARD,SHELDON

14097,That happened to you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14098,I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.,SHELDON,PENNY
14099,Sounds fun.,LEONARD,LEONARD
14100,"You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.",SHELDON,SHELDON

14132,Thank you.,SHELDON,HOWARD
14133,"Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.",HOWARD,RAJ
14134,"I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?",RAJ,SHELDON
14135,"I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.",RAJ,PENNY

14144,And what?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14145,How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.,LEONARD,RAJ
14146,"Oh, I’m gonna miss you.  See you later.",PENNY,LEONARD
14147,"Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14148,"Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14149,You ever play football?,HOWARD,PENNY
14150,"I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.",PENNY,LEONARD

14159,"If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?",LEONARD,SHELDON
14160,"Oh, teacher! Me! Me!",LEONARD,LEONARD
14161,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14162,"Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?",PENNY,LEONARD
14163,I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?,HOWARD,LEONARD
14164,But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.,SHELDON,OTHERS
14165,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",SHELDON,HOWARD
14166,To my room.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14167,"And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?",LEONARD,LEONARD
14168,Yeah? So?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14169,"You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.",HOWARD,OTHERS
14170,"Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?",SHELDON,HOWARD
14171,Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14172,"Isn’t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.",HOWARD,SHELDON
14173,Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?,RAJ,SHELDON
14174,"It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14175,"All right, let’s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14176,I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.,OTHERS,SHELDON
14177,"Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?",LEONARD,SHELDON
14178,Find new friends.,RAJ,SHELDON
14179,Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?,PENNY,LEONARD
14180,"Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?",HOWARD,HOWARD
14181,"Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14182,"Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14183,Yes. You’re either with me or against me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14184,What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.,HOWARD,SHELDON
14185,"It’s okay, Leonard",PENNY,LEONARD
14186,"Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14187,"Oh come on, really?",PENNY,OTHERS
14188,Oh. Really?,OTHERS,LEONARD
14189,He was drunk.,PENNY,SHELDON
14190,"Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14191,"No, I mean just you and me.",LEONARD,PENNY
14192,Try another one.,HOWARD,LEONARD
14193,"Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!",SHELDON,RAJ
14194,So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
14195,"Why, is Leonard okay.",PENNY,OTHERS
14196,Is the point that you’re an idiot?,HOWARD,LEONARD
14197,"I don’t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.",PENNY,HOWARD
14198,"I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14199,I don’t think he had a family.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14200,"It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.",SHELDON,OTHERS
14201,"Thanks for understanding, Howard.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14202,I own nine pairs of pants.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14203,Sure. What are you doing?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14204,"Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?",OTHERS,SHELDON
14205,Just ignore him.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14206,"Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14207,"Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.",PENNY,SHELDON
14208,"No, no. I want to know what you told her.",PENNY,HOWARD
14209,"It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway.",LEONARD,PENNY
14210,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon.",PENNY,PENNY
14211,"Oh, I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions.",SHELDON,RAJ
14212,"Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?",PENNY,SHELDON
14213,"Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him.",PENNY,OTHERS
14214,Yes.,LEONARD,OTHERS
14215,Is there any part of your body that’s normal?,PENNY,SHELDON
14216,"Here, have some pizza, sweetie.",PENNY,HOWARD
14217,"Okay. Um, let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect.",PENNY,SHELDON
14218,"Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14219,Oh.,SHELDON,HOWARD
14220,"Here you go, cute huh?",RAJ,SHELDON
14221,"Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14222,"Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14223,How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?,OTHERS,PENNY
14224,"Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.",PENNY,SHELDON
14225,"No, it’s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14226,What just happened?,SHELDON,PENNY
14227,That’s it? Good”,SHELDON,LEONARD
14228,"Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14229,"Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”",SHELDON,LEONARD
14230,"Oh, you forgot your quartz.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14231,"Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me.",SHELDON,HOWARD
14232,"Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.",OTHERS,HOWARD
14233,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14234,May I ask what this is about?,RAJ,LEONARD
14235,"Oh, come on, what is that?",PENNY,LEONARD
14236,"Yeah, I think we’re getting close.",RAJ,SHELDON
14237,No trouble at all.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14238,"It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14239,"Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14240,"I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14241,Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?,LEONARD,PENNY
14242,"Like, really, a million?",RAJ,SHELDON
14243,"I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14244,"No, he doesn’t.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14245,"Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14246,"Oh, thanks.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14247,"Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14248,Uh.,PENNY,PENNY
14249,I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.,RAJ,SHELDON
14250,"Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?",SHELDON,SHELDON
14251,You know I struggle with Batman.,RAJ,SHELDON
14252,"Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14253,"Well, you barely looked. Let me see.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14254,"I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.",RAJ,SHELDON
14255,"Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain..",PENNY,LEONARD
14256,Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.,OTHERS,SHELDON

14258,Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?,SHELDON,SHELDON
14259,"Oh, my God.",PENNY,LEONARD
14260,As is the company.,LEONARD,PENNY
14261,"Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.",LEONARD,PENNY
14262,I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.,HOWARD,SHELDON
14263,"You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.",SHELDON,PENNY
14264,I missed you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
14265,Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.,SHELDON,HOWARD

14268,Okay? It’s magnificent.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14269,All right.,SHELDON,PENNY
14270,What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?,OTHERS,LEONARD
14271,You could start by taking an interest in his work.,OTHERS,SHELDON
14272,"Oh, please don’t.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14273,Fine.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14274,No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.,SHELDON,PENNY
14275,"Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?",RAJ,LEONARD
14276,Just play a potion card.,LEONARD,HOWARD
14277,"So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.",RAJ,HOWARD
14278,"No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…",PENNY,SHELDON
14279,Why me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14280,"And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?",SHELDON,RAJ
14281,That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.,LEONARD,HOWARD
14282,"All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?",PENNY,SHELDON
14283,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14284,"Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.",RAJ,PENNY

14290,"How about that, you were right.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14291,"Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14292,All right.,OTHERS,LEONARD
14293,"Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?",RAJ,PENNY
14294,My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14295,Ready for lunch?,RAJ,PENNY
14296,"I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.",LEONARD,HOWARD
14297,Where are you going?,HOWARD,SHELDON
14298,"Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14299,"Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.",LEONARD,LEONARD

14301,Sorry. I lost my cool.,RAJ,PENNY
14302,"I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14303,"Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?",RAJ,LEONARD
14304,We understand. Thank you so much.,LEONARD,SHELDON

14308,"If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14309,Yello.,PENNY,HOWARD
14310,Does it sound sexy?,HOWARD,HOWARD
14311,Sorry.,PENNY,SHELDON
14312,How am I looking now?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14313,"That’s okay, I never understood them anyway.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14314,"Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14315,I can’t believe I’m doing this.,PENNY,HOWARD

14317,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
14318,"You’re a lucky man, Leonard.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14319,What is it?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14320,Thank you.,SHELDON,PENNY
14321,"So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14322,"Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.",PENNY,PENNY
14323,"How could there be, with these constant interruptions?",SHELDON,HOWARD
14324,"It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14325,Why not?,SHELDON,LEONARD
14326,"Welcome to Long Island, Tex.",PENNY,LEONARD
14327,Doesn’t have to be Asian.,RAJ,SHELDON
14328,"Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?",LEONARD,RAJ
14329,"So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?",SHELDON,SHELDON
14330,Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.,OTHERS,SHELDON
14331,"Oh, I’m so sorry.",OTHERS,LEONARD

14333,You did go pfft.,LEONARD,RAJ
14334,"Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?",HOWARD,PENNY

14336,"All right, I tried.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14337,Your point being?,SHELDON,PENNY
14338,"No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.",RAJ,SHELDON
14339,"She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.",HOWARD,PENNY
14340,Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.,OTHERS,LEONARD

14342,"He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.",SHELDON,PENNY
14343,But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.,OTHERS,LEONARD

14354,"Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me.",LEONARD,LEONARD

14356,"Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery.",OTHERS,PENNY
14357,Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.,OTHERS,SHELDON
14358,I’m gonna need another clue.,PENNY,SHELDON
14359,"Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.",HOWARD,SHELDON
14360,"You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?",HOWARD,SHELDON
14361,With you?,SHELDON,RAJ
14362,"I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.",RAJ,OTHERS
14363,My original point.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14364,We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.,SHELDON,PENNY
14365,That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…,SHELDON,LEONARD
14366,How you feeling?,HOWARD,LEONARD
14367,"Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.",RAJ,SHELDON
14368,I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.,PENNY,SHELDON
14369,"Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14370,Sheldon.,PENNY,LEONARD
14371,Like what?,RAJ,LEONARD
14372,But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
14373,"Yeah, sure.",LEONARD,PENNY
14374,"I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14375,I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?,SHELDON,PENNY
14376,How does that involve air travel?,LEONARD,SHELDON

14378,Obi-what?,OTHERS,SHELDON
14379,Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14380,I’ll be right back.,SHELDON,PENNY
14381,Great. Do it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
14382,I am not going to have sex with her.,LEONARD,LEONARD
14383,"Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.",HOWARD,PENNY
14384,I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.,RAJ,LEONARD
14385,Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.,RAJ,SHELDON
14386,"Ah, well, in this context…",RAJ,PENNY
14387,What’s up?,PENNY,SHELDON
14388,You can keep that too.,PENNY,OTHERS
14389,"Well, one of them is.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14390,"Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?",RAJ,HOWARD

14392,Meh.,SHELDON,HOWARD
14393,"Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14394,"Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14395,Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14396,"Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14397,"Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14398,"No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14399,"Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?",RAJ,PENNY
14400,"Mmmm, not bad.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14401,"All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.",PENNY,PENNY
14402,Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.,LEONARD,LEONARD
14403,Who were you in couples therapy with?,OTHERS,HOWARD
14404,Why?,SHELDON,PENNY
14405,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON

14408,"Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.",RAJ,LEONARD
14409,"Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there.",PENNY,PENNY
14410,"Whatever, I’ll figure it out myself.",PENNY,PENNY
14411,But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.,SHELDON,PENNY
14412,"You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?",SHELDON,SHELDON
14413,Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14414,"Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?",LEONARD,SHELDON
14415,Certainly.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14416,"It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am.",HOWARD,SHELDON
14417,"Um, eight.  Point four.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14418,Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?,LEONARD,SHELDON
14419,No. But thank you for asking.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14420,It sucks to be you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14421,"Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14422,That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.,PENNY,SHELDON
14423,"Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks.",SHELDON,HOWARD
14424,"It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?",RAJ,RAJ
14425,"Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14426,Hey.,RAJ,LEONARD
14427,"That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14428,It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
14429,"I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
14430,"Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.",RAJ,LEONARD
14431,"And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14432,"Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.",PENNY,SHELDON
14433,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
14434,"If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14435,Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.,LEONARD,LEONARD
14436,Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?,LEONARD,LEONARD
14437,"So, how was paintball, did you have fun?",PENNY,SHELDON
14438,"All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14439,"No, that seemed a little farfetched.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14440,It’s right here.,RAJ,HOWARD
14441,You realize you and I could become brothers.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14442,"Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…",LEONARD,SHELDON
14443,You got yourself a sleepover.,OTHERS,PENNY
14444,"You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food.",SHELDON,RAJ
14445,"When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?",OTHERS,HOWARD
14446,"Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14447,"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.",SHELDON,HOWARD
14448,Remember that before you post on Yelp.,OTHERS,LEONARD
14449,"Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14450,That was fast.,LEONARD,PENNY
14451,"Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14452,"Uh, good. Is Mom around?",PENNY,PENNY
14453,Keep going.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14454,"We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14455,And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14456,"Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.",HOWARD,OTHERS
14457,"We’re fine, Sheldon.",LEONARD,PENNY
14458,There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14459,"Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.",LEONARD,PENNY
14460,"Ah, sure. That’d be nice.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14461,"If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.",PENNY,RAJ
14462,How?,HOWARD,SHELDON
14463,"No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.",PENNY,OTHERS
14464,"We might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14465,"But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da.",HOWARD,SHELDON
14466,"I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?",SHELDON,SHELDON
14467,"Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I’ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty…  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",PENNY,OTHERS

14470,Why?,PENNY,LEONARD
14471,"No, I did not.",LEONARD,PENNY
14472,Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?,SHELDON,PENNY
14473,That’s it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
14474,"Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14475,"All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14476,Hello.,RAJ,LEONARD
14477,"And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…",SHELDON,HOWARD
14478,"Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?",PENNY,SHELDON
14479,I’m back.,SHELDON,PENNY
14480,Hurry.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14481,"Amy, you look great.",PENNY,PENNY
14482,"This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14483,"My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?",RAJ,SHELDON
14484,"Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14485,"Oh, muffin much.",OTHERS,HOWARD
14486,"Fine, then that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14487,"No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14488,"Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic.",OTHERS,HOWARD
14489,We like games.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14490,"I don’t, either.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14491,"Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14492,"When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.",LEONARD,PENNY
14493,Only you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14494,"Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14495,"Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14496,"All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.",SHELDON,PENNY
14497,You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.,PENNY,OTHERS
14498,What do we have to lose?,SHELDON,LEONARD
14499,"You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14500,"Permission granted, Commander.",SHELDON,HOWARD
14501,Raj.,OTHERS,RAJ
14502,"Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.",LEONARD,HOWARD
14503,"I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes.",HOWARD,SHELDON
14504,"All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?",HOWARD,SHELDON
14505,I thought you had plans with Amy.,LEONARD,PENNY
14506,What’s with the clothes?,OTHERS,SHELDON
14507,"No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.",SHELDON,RAJ
14508,It is. You’re the best dad ever.,PENNY,HOWARD
14509,"Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.",PENNY,SHELDON
14510,"Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.",PENNY,RAJ
14511,There’s no reason to worry.,RAJ,LEONARD
14512,"Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?",SHELDON,HOWARD
14513,I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.,SHELDON,RAJ
14514,Not yet.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14515,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON

14517,Should I follow you?,SHELDON,LEONARD
14518,I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.,RAJ,HOWARD

14521,Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14522,"Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?",SHELDON,PENNY
14523,"I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14524,And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.,OTHERS,PENNY
14525,"So, your project is more important than mine?",SHELDON,SHELDON
14526,Try dialing.,PENNY,SHELDON
14527,Oh. Okay. Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14528,"It’s okay, I’m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?",OTHERS,OTHERS
14529,Some girl named Mandy.,PENNY,LEONARD
14530,"I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14531,"Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now.",PENNY,HOWARD
14532,"No, you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.",RAJ,HOWARD
14533,"Yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14534,How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?,RAJ,RAJ
14535,"That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?",SHELDON,SHELDON
14536,Hey.,PENNY,SHELDON
14537,Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.,OTHERS,LEONARD
14538,"Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?",RAJ,SHELDON
14539,Got it.,PENNY,PENNY
14540,"Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.",RAJ,SHELDON
14541,Why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?,HOWARD,LEONARD
14542,Well?,PENNY,OTHERS
14543,"Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?",PENNY,SHELDON
14544,"So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard’s mom’s underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn’t enough. Nothing will ever be enough.",OTHERS,PENNY
14545,"No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14546,"Hey, Stuart.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14547,"Let it go, Sheldon.",HOWARD,OTHERS
14548,Since when do you work on weekends?,OTHERS,SHELDON
14549,Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise.,HOWARD,HOWARD
14550,"Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14551,"Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.",LEONARD,LEONARD
14552,I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we shouldn’t.,HOWARD,SHELDON

14558,"I was crushing it, but all right.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14559,"Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut.",OTHERS,RAJ
14560,I give up.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14561,Not a chance.,PENNY,LEONARD
14562,"Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14563,"Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14564,"Okay, it’s on.",LEONARD,PENNY

14572,"All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?",SHELDON,LEONARD
14573,"No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon’s job.",LEONARD,RAJ
14574,"I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “Fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” That means: “Fever 104, home of the really good current music.” It’s much catchier in Hindi.",RAJ,LEONARD
14575,"It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz.",LEONARD,RAJ
14576,"Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.",PENNY,LEONARD
14577,Sure.,HOWARD,PENNY
14578,"Oh. Hey, what smells so good?",PENNY,LEONARD
14579,He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.,HOWARD,PENNY

14588,"Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!",PENNY,LEONARD
14589,I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14590,"Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
14591,"Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.",SHELDON,LEONARD
14592,"My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one.",HOWARD,HOWARD

14606,You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
14607,I’m calling him.,PENNY,LEONARD
14608,That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!,SHELDON,SHELDON
14609,I thought you were reading.,LEONARD,LEONARD

14611,Yeah.,SHELDON,SHELDON
14612,"Excuse me, little idea?",SHELDON,PENNY
14613,"Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?",SHELDON,LEONARD
14614,I blame Penny.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14615,What do you see in her?,SHELDON,SHELDON
14616,I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.,SHELDON,PENNY

14637,"Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.",SHELDON,RAJ
14638,I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.,OTHERS,HOWARD
14639,"Hang on. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We’ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.",LEONARD,PENNY
14640,"You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.",RAJ,HOWARD
14641,"In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.",SHELDON,SHELDON

14681,"Um, home, to write some bad cheques.",PENNY,HOWARD
14682,"Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.",OTHERS,SHELDON
14683,Thanks for bringing me home.,SHELDON,RAJ
14684,"Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.",RAJ,LEONARD
14685,"Good-Bye, Sheldon.",LEONARD,OTHERS
14686,Mm.,PENNY,LEONARD

14688,"Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…",OTHERS,SHELDON
14689,"Okay, we’re going to stick this in here  and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants.",HOWARD,PENNY
14690,"Alright, I’ll be right back.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14691,All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.,LEONARD,LEONARD
14692,What did we do?,OTHERS,LEONARD
14693,Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.,LEONARD,SHELDON
14694,"She’s tired, that was funny.",RAJ,LEONARD
14695,Why?,LEONARD,PENNY
14696,"Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight.",LEONARD,HOWARD
14697,"Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.",RAJ,LEONARD
14698,"Well, chafing, right?",LEONARD,LEONARD
14699,"Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.",PENNY,RAJ

14701,Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14702,Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.,SHELDON,OTHERS

14704,"Hang on, there really is a lady here?",HOWARD,LEONARD
14705,For now.,OTHERS,LEONARD

14710,"That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  I’m not necessarily talking to the food.",HOWARD,OTHERS
14711,"Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?",LEONARD,SHELDON
14712,"Oh, okay, alright, good.",LEONARD,PENNY
14713,Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.,PENNY,LEONARD

14716,Open the door now.,PENNY,PENNY
14717,"Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14718,A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.,HOWARD,SHELDON

14724,"Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car.",PENNY,LEONARD
14725,"Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.",PENNY,HOWARD
14726,And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.,PENNY,LEONARD
14727,"Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.",RAJ,HOWARD
14728,"Me, too. But what?",RAJ,OTHERS
14729,He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve.,HOWARD,SHELDON
14730,"Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14731,"You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!",PENNY,LEONARD
14732,Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?,LEONARD,HOWARD
14733,"Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.",LEONARD,SHELDON
14734,"Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14735,"Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.",HOWARD,SHELDON
14736,Why did you bring that?,HOWARD,RAJ
14737,This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.,OTHERS,SHELDON

14746,"So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?",HOWARD,RAJ
14747,: Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.,SHELDON,LEONARD
14748,"Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.",SHELDON,RAJ
14749,"Oh, yeah.",SHELDON,PENNY
14750,"Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?",HOWARD,LEONARD
14751,"I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
14752,Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?,PENNY,SHELDON
14753,What is the harm if I audition?,PENNY,SHELDON
14754,"Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones.",PENNY,LEONARD

14757,"Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.",HOWARD,LEONARD
14758,"One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle.

14760,Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.,OTHERS,RAJ
14761,Do or do not. There is no try.,PENNY,HOWARD
14762,"Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”",PENNY,SHELDON

14764,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY

14766,That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.,RAJ,LEONARD

14768,"Bye, buddy. Sheldon?",LEONARD,SHELDON
14769,"And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.",SHELDON,LEONARD

14790,"Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?",LEONARD,SHELDON

15192,I didn’t betray Penny.,LEONARD,PENNY

15205,"Thank you, Barry.",LEONARD,RAJ
15206,"Me, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON

15225,I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.,OTHERS,LEONARD
15226,I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?,SHELDON,RAJ
15227,"Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
15228,"Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you.",PENNY,LEONARD

15230,Go away.,RAJ,SHELDON
15231,"That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.",SHELDON,SHELDON

15233,"Although, Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15234,No way.,OTHERS,PENNY
15235,"All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?",OTHERS,SHELDON

15264,But I don’t want to go to bed.,SHELDON,PENNY

15375,"No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.",LEONARD,SHELDON
15376,"Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological…  Okay, that’s pretty good.",OTHERS,LEONARD

15499,"But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?",HOWARD,PENNY

15601,"President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

15618,What a douche.,RAJ,LEONARD

15640,Should I go after you?,HOWARD,LEONARD
15641,Ointment?,SHELDON,HOWARD
15642,That’s very offensive.,RAJ,SHELDON

15661,Sorry.,HOWARD,LEONARD
15662,That’s my parking spot.,SHELDON,SHELDON
15663,"I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on.",HOWARD,SHELDON
15664,"You didn’t do anything, it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow.",LEONARD,PENNY
15665,Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.,PENNY,LEONARD
15666,Why?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15667,I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?,SHELDON,LEONARD

15691,Good.,PENNY,HOWARD

15694,"Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?",HOWARD,HOWARD
15695,All right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
15696,I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.,OTHERS,SHELDON
15697,You were trying to blow up my head.,LEONARD,HOWARD

15709,High five. Not too hard. Thank you.,SHELDON,RAJ
15710,We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.,SHELDON,LEONARD
15711,You’re the one who invited him here.,LEONARD,PENNY
15712,"Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.",OTHERS,SHELDON
15713,"Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?",HOWARD,SHELDON
15714,You’d think that. But no.,HOWARD,SHELDON
15715,"You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?",HOWARD,LEONARD
15716,This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.,OTHERS,OTHERS
15717,Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15718,"Well, it’s probably not for me.",HOWARD,RAJ
15719,"Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.",LEONARD,LEONARD
15720,So you’re gonna be roommates with Bert?,OTHERS,LEONARD
15721,It’s a big deal. There’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you’d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.,HOWARD,PENNY
15722,"Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.",OTHERS,OTHERS
15723,"No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15724,Guava?,LEONARD,PENNY
15725,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
15726,"Penny,  Penny,  Penny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
15727,"Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.",SHELDON,RAJ
15728,"Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?",HOWARD,OTHERS
15729,"Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15730,"No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.",LEONARD,LEONARD
15731,"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.",SHELDON,PENNY
15732,"And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.",HOWARD,PENNY
15733,"No, as long as it bobbles.",SHELDON,PENNY
15734,"It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?",SHELDON,SHELDON
15735,"As it turns out, yes.",RAJ,PENNY
15736,"Now, today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…",SHELDON,LEONARD

15740,"Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated.",PENNY,LEONARD
15741,"Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!",RAJ,SHELDON
15742,"If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.",RAJ,SHELDON
15743,Does it have a camera in it?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15744,Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15745,Really?,SHELDON,PENNY
15746,"They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.",HOWARD,SHELDON
15747,"That was awkward, right?",SHELDON,SHELDON
15748,"I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.",OTHERS,SHELDON
15749,Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?,OTHERS,OTHERS
15750,Yeah?,HOWARD,SHELDON
15751,But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.,SHELDON,PENNY
15752,Hey.,LEONARD,HOWARD
15753,"If anybody cares, I still have to pee.",RAJ,SHELDON
15754,Cheers.,RAJ,HOWARD
15755,"I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?",LEONARD,SHELDON
15756,That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition,SHELDON,SHELDON
15757,You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.,SHELDON,LEONARD
15758,I missed you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
15759,You want to be green?,SHELDON,HOWARD
15760,Yeah.,LEONARD,SHELDON
15761,"You know, this reminds me of high school.",RAJ,LEONARD
15762,Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?,HOWARD,LEONARD
15763,"Oh, there it is, tacos.",SHELDON,LEONARD
15764,Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.,LEONARD,HOWARD
15765,"From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.",OTHERS,SHELDON
15766,Great.,HOWARD,LEONARD
15767,"That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom.",SHELDON,LEONARD
15768,Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?,PENNY,SHELDON
15769,"Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.",PENNY,LEONARD
15770,Those are Howard’s.,SHELDON,LEONARD
15771,Is it okay if I get some sleep?,HOWARD,SHELDON
15772,"Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?",OTHERS,SHELDON
15773,So should we go talk to him?,RAJ,LEONARD
15774,"Uh, sweetie, are you all right?",PENNY,PENNY
15775,Come at me. See what happens.,OTHERS,SHELDON
15776,"Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.",LEONARD,PENNY
15777,"So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together.",OTHERS,PENNY
15778,I need some context.,OTHERS,LEONARD
15779,"Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.",LEONARD,SHELDON
15780,"Olive you, too.",HOWARD,LEONARD
15781,"Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?",LEONARD,PENNY
15782,"If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store.",LEONARD,PENNY
15783,"Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?",SHELDON,LEONARD
15784,We really need a strike here.,LEONARD,PENNY
15785,"Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope’s back online.",PENNY,SHELDON
15786,"But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.",LEONARD,LEONARD
15787,Cover for me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
15788,"All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?",LEONARD,HOWARD
15789,"Yeah, everything was delicious.",OTHERS,HOWARD
15790,"No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?",PENNY,SHELDON
15791,Leonard’s Day?,PENNY,SHELDON
15792,How could you lose that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15793,"This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.",OTHERS,SHELDON
15794,"She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
15795,You don’t jog.,SHELDON,OTHERS
15796,"In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.",LEONARD,PENNY
15797,"Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.",OTHERS,LEONARD
15798,"Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?",LEONARD,SHELDON
15799,"This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?",SHELDON,PENNY
15800,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
15801,"Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.",OTHERS,SHELDON
15802,Who‘s there?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15803,But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…,RAJ,PENNY
15804,Okay.,OTHERS,PENNY
15805,Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.,HOWARD,LEONARD
15806,I’m getting enraged.,LEONARD,SHELDON
15807,"Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.",RAJ,SHELDON
15808,"Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision.",RAJ,PENNY
15809,Hang on. That was just me joking around.,HOWARD,LEONARD
15810,"Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.",LEONARD,PENNY
15811,There was no question. I simply said hoo.,OTHERS,SHELDON
15812,Thank you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
15813,A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.,SHELDON,LEONARD
15814,I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.,SHELDON,PENNY
15815,"Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.",SHELDON,LEONARD
15816,I’m starting to think you’re right.,OTHERS,PENNY
15817,"Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.",HOWARD,HOWARD
15818,"No, you told me.",PENNY,PENNY
15819,You whistled?,SHELDON,SHELDON
15820,She sounds really mad.,OTHERS,SHELDON
15821,"Anyway, wish me luck.",LEONARD,LEONARD
15822,Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
15823,"Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15824,"What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?",RAJ,LEONARD
15825,Where are you going?,PENNY,HOWARD
15826,"You don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings, you say keep true.",HOWARD,PENNY
15827,"Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?",SHELDON,PENNY
15828,Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,PENNY
15829,Wha… You’re kidding!,RAJ,RAJ
15830,"Yeah, he’s a gift all right.",PENNY,SHELDON
15831,"Also, Sheldon may be a robot.",RAJ,PENNY
15832,So nothing.,HOWARD,PENNY
15833,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
15834,Why?,HOWARD,SHELDON
15835,"Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.",LEONARD,HOWARD
15836,"Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?",PENNY,HOWARD
15837,Football or chicken-fried meats?,SHELDON,HOWARD
15838,How is it okay?,PENNY,PENNY
15839,Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?,LEONARD,HOWARD
15840,Well why not?,HOWARD,LEONARD
15841,"Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.",HOWARD,LEONARD
15842,Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.,LEONARD,LEONARD
15843,What does your agent think?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15844,"Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15845,Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.,SHELDON,LEONARD
15846,Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.,HOWARD,HOWARD
15847,"That’s your card, right?",HOWARD,RAJ
15848,Of course.,LEONARD,SHELDON
15849,Kites ho!,RAJ,LEONARD
15850,It turns you on when I sound like Raj?,OTHERS,SHELDON
15851,You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.,SHELDON,LEONARD
15852,"Oh, God, that is so romantic.",OTHERS,OTHERS
15853,"What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you.",RAJ,LEONARD
15854,"Oh, Leonard?",PENNY,LEONARD
15855,"Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?",RAJ,SHELDON
15856,"Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15857,Goodbye.,OTHERS,LEONARD
15858,I guess.,OTHERS,LEONARD
15859,Okay.,LEONARD,LEONARD
15860,"Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
15861,"Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.",OTHERS,LEONARD
15862,Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?,RAJ,PENNY
15863,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
15864,They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.,HOWARD,LEONARD
15865,"Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better.",LEONARD,SHELDON
15866,I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!,SHELDON,PENNY
15867,"Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.",OTHERS,RAJ
15868,I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?,LEONARD,SHELDON
15869,What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?,OTHERS,LEONARD
15870,"If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.",RAJ,SHELDON
15871,"What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15872,"Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball.",RAJ,PENNY
15873,"Where’s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.",HOWARD,SHELDON
15874,Are you sleeping?,SHELDON,SHELDON
15875,Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.,HOWARD,PENNY
15876,"No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.",LEONARD,LEONARD
15877,"You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.",LEONARD,HOWARD
15878,"Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.",HOWARD,OTHERS
15879,Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?,SHELDON,HOWARD
15880,Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.,RAJ,HOWARD
15881,"No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.",LEONARD,RAJ
15882,What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.,RAJ,HOWARD
15883,Emotionally.,PENNY,SHELDON
15884,Why not?,SHELDON,LEONARD
15885,"At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.",RAJ,SHELDON
15886,"Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  just be information  on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.  So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.",LEONARD,PENNY
15887,"Oh, my God, that’s terrible.",OTHERS,OTHERS
15888,You should be so lucky.,HOWARD,PENNY
15889,Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
15890,"Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.",SHELDON,SHELDON
15891,"Oh, that’s true. It’s not like we can get in there.",LEONARD,SHELDON
15892,"Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.",PENNY,SHELDON
15893,You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.,OTHERS,LEONARD
15894,That’s a great idea.,PENNY,LEONARD
15895,A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?,HOWARD,LEONARD
15896,"I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.",OTHERS,HOWARD
15897,"Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?",LEONARD,LEONARD
15898,"Sure, sorry.",HOWARD,SHELDON
15899,Horse.,HOWARD,SHELDON

16171,"Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16172,"Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine.",HOWARD,LEONARD
16173,Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.,PENNY,RAJ
16174,That.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16175,Is something bothering you?,OTHERS,LEONARD
16176,"I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.",RAJ,SHELDON
16177,Wet wall?,PENNY,LEONARD
16178,"I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16179,I’m not sure.,PENNY,LEONARD
16180,There are no rules in hell!,RAJ,SHELDON
16181,By yourself?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16182,"So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?",HOWARD,LEONARD
16183,Have I ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16184,Why don’t I run away and you cover me?,HOWARD,LEONARD
16185,I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16186,Hi.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16187,"Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.",PENNY,SHELDON
16188,Yay.,OTHERS,HOWARD
16189,"Oh, hi Stephanie.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16190,"Oh, wow, a girl scientist.",PENNY,LEONARD
16191,"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16192,"Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away.",PENNY,PENNY
16193,Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?,PENNY,SHELDON
16194,I’ll make the popcorn.,RAJ,OTHERS
16195,From nuts?,HOWARD,PENNY

16197,"It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16198,"Sheldon, don’t overreact.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16199,"Well, that sounds even better.",OTHERS,LEONARD
16200,They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16201,"For starters, they shed and bite.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16202,I know.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16203,I want a different question.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16204,"If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one.",RAJ,LEONARD
16205,"He didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.",PENNY,HOWARD
16206,"I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don’t think I’m the problem.",OTHERS,HOWARD
16207,"Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.",OTHERS,PENNY
16208,Wouldn’t that be nice.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16209,I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16210,It’s not crazy.,LEONARD,LEONARD
16211,"Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now.",OTHERS,PENNY
16212,Okay. Fine.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16213,"I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.",PENNY,LEONARD
16214,"Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.",OTHERS,PENNY
16215,"Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16216,"In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16217,Yeah. Yeah.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16218,Maybe that’s because it’s classified.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16219,"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16220,Doctor Cooper.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16221,I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?,LEONARD,SHELDON
16222,"When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto",SHELDON,LEONARD
16223,Thank you kindly.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16224,Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16225,"Hey, look, the lug nut’s off.",RAJ,HOWARD
16226,"Man, I walked right into that one.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16227,I’m unhappy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16228,Really?,SHELDON,LEONARD
16229,She’s lucky you were there.,OTHERS,RAJ
16230,So it was working.,SHELDON,PENNY
16231,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?,SHELDON,PENNY
16232,And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.,LEONARD,HOWARD
16233,He’s such a sweetie.,OTHERS,PENNY
16234,It’s a good sign.,RAJ,SHELDON
16235,She’s so considerate.,RAJ,LEONARD

16239,"Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?",RAJ,LEONARD
16240,Suffered in silence?,LEONARD,SHELDON

16243,"Hello, Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
16244,I think you made that very clear.,RAJ,LEONARD
16245,Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.,LEONARD,HOWARD
16246,Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.,LEONARD,PENNY
16247,"We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let’s party.",OTHERS,LEONARD
16248,Excuse me?,PENNY,SHELDON
16249,"Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.",SHELDON,PENNY
16250,"Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.",SHELDON,PENNY
16251,"Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16252,"He knows, wow.",LEONARD,PENNY
16253,That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16254,It’s like living with a Chihuahua.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16255,"Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?",PENNY,LEONARD
16256,"A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.",HOWARD,HOWARD
16257,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.,RAJ,LEONARD
16258,Ugh. Leonard?,PENNY,LEONARD
16259,"Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.",RAJ,HOWARD
16260,You can’t be this proud.,PENNY,SHELDON
16261,"Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.",SHELDON,PENNY
16262,What about that little cup they give you?,RAJ,HOWARD
16263,A quarter.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16264,Yes. How have you been?,OTHERS,OTHERS
16265,What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16266,"I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.",OTHERS,PENNY

16268,Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.,SHELDON,RAJ
16269,"Well, Vegas, but…",LEONARD,OTHERS
16270,"This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16271,What did you say to your mother?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16272,So how do I undo this?,PENNY,LEONARD
16273,"Or worse, up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16274,It’s getting harder to pretend.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16275,You Indian.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16276,You can hear my toilet flush?,PENNY,RAJ
16277,All right.,HOWARD,LEONARD
16278,"I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.",RAJ,SHELDON
16279,"Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?",SHELDON,SHELDON
16280,"You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy.",HOWARD,SHELDON

16282,"All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up.",PENNY,PENNY
16283,"Come on, do I really have to?",PENNY,PENNY
16284,I want a divorce.,PENNY,LEONARD
16285,I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.,PENNY,HOWARD
16286,That’s close enough.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16287,"It’s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?",HOWARD,HOWARD
16288,"Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16289,"Wow, you don’t look that much alike.",PENNY,SHELDON
16290,I don’t know. What do you want to do?,SHELDON,SHELDON

16295,Why?,OTHERS,PENNY
16296,"Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16297,Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.,RAJ,SHELDON
16298,The two of them? I don’t understand.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16299,"Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile.",HOWARD,RAJ

16301,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
16302,"Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?",LEONARD,SHELDON
16303,I’m okay. How was the funeral?,SHELDON,LEONARD
16304,"No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.",RAJ,SHELDON
16305,Why’d you bring him?,OTHERS,LEONARD
16306,"Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16307,"Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.",SHELDON,PENNY
16308,Wow. How’s he doing?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16309,I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.,RAJ,LEONARD
16310,"It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…",LEONARD,PENNY
16311,Truth.,PENNY,LEONARD
16312,"Yeah, I’m doing a global warming panel.",OTHERS,PENNY
16313,Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.,OTHERS,SHELDON

16315,That’s what I told my lawyers.,OTHERS,PENNY
16316,You’re making her uncomfortable.,LEONARD,PENNY
16317,Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.,PENNY,SHELDON
16318,"Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.",LEONARD,OTHERS

16324,"You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16325,Leonard.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16326,"Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16327,I know.,PENNY,SHELDON
16328,And what does that have to do with flags?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16329,"Yeah, yeah, I get it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16330,"He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.",OTHERS,SHELDON

16332,"Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.",LEONARD,PENNY
16333,The walls stop. You’re safe.,LEONARD,HOWARD
16334,Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16335,Give my friend his stuff back.,PENNY,LEONARD
16336,Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16337,"I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16338,"Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16339,Very well. I’ll set the scene.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16340,And what special circumstances are those?,SHELDON,LEONARD
16341,"Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?",LEONARD,LEONARD
16342,Who is that?,HOWARD,SHELDON
16343,Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?,OTHERS,PENNY
16344,"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?",SHELDON,LEONARD
16345,"Oh, yes.",SHELDON,PENNY
16346,"Uh, yeah, uh, right here.",LEONARD,PENNY
16347,"Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master.",HOWARD,LEONARD

16349,What is it?,LEONARD,PENNY
16350,"You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16351,Thanks.,RAJ,SHELDON
16352,"Well, I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?",LEONARD,SHELDON
16353,Great.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16354,"Damn, you’re sneaky.",PENNY,PENNY
16355,"All right, let’s do it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16356,I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.,RAJ,PENNY
16357,Uh.,RAJ,SHELDON
16358,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?",LEONARD,SHELDON
16359,"Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16360,"I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.",SHELDON,PENNY
16361,You get where I’m going here?,SHELDON,PENNY
16362,"I’m sorry, I don’t get the point.",PENNY,RAJ
16363,Hand me the bat.,LEONARD,PENNY

16370,Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?,PENNY,RAJ

16374,"Hey, I got a favour to ask.",HOWARD,HOWARD
16375,Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.,PENNY,SHELDON
16376,"It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I’m doing.",PENNY,SHELDON
16377,"Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16378,"Raj, why don’t I care about anything?",OTHERS,SHELDON
16379,Thanks.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16380,"He’s irony impaired, just move on.",LEONARD,PENNY
16381,Good idea. They’ll be refreshed.,RAJ,SHELDON
16382,"Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?",SHELDON,OTHERS
16383,"No, it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.",RAJ,SHELDON
16384,"Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?",OTHERS,SHELDON
16385,"So, where were we?",OTHERS,LEONARD
16386,"Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up.",OTHERS,RAJ
16387,Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.,OTHERS,OTHERS
16388,"Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16389,The only thing in here are blue ice packs.,LEONARD,HOWARD
16390,"He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers?

16391,She’s gonna know I was looking in it.,RAJ,RAJ
16392,So what’s up?,RAJ,LEONARD
16393,"Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?",PENNY,SHELDON
16394,"Great, Ma!",HOWARD,SHELDON
16395,"Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.",LEONARD,LEONARD

16402,"Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B.",SHELDON,PENNY
16403,"Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16404,Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.,LEONARD,OTHERS
16405,Rajesh?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16406,Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.,PENNY,SHELDON

16408,"Dude, I am so sorry.",RAJ,PENNY
16409,Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.,LEONARD,LEONARD
16410,Not at all.,SHELDON,LEONARD

16414,Address?,RAJ,RAJ
16415,I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.,RAJ,SHELDON

16420,"Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16421,He slipped and fell.,PENNY,LEONARD
16422,Okay.,PENNY,PENNY
16423,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16424,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16425,You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.,SHELDON,SHELDON

16431,Thank you.,OTHERS,SHELDON

16435,My struggle is emotional.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16436,"Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16437,"Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big.",OTHERS,LEONARD
16438,"Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?",SHELDON,LEONARD
16439,"Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.",RAJ,SHELDON

16442,Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16443,You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16444,I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?,SHELDON,SHELDON

16446,"You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16447,"With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.",LEONARD,PENNY
16448,Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.,RAJ,RAJ
16449,But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.,OTHERS,HOWARD
16450,Wow. Look at that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16451,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?",PENNY,SHELDON

16572,Keep your voice down.,LEONARD,LEONARD
16573,I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16574,How’s that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
16575,I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.,LEONARD,PENNY
16576,I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?,RAJ,SHELDON
16577,"You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.",LEONARD,PENNY
16578,"Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.",PENNY,SHELDON
16579,"There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16580,"Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?",OTHERS,SHELDON
16581,"Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.",LEONARD,PENNY

16588,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16589,You want to come watch?,LEONARD,OTHERS

16591,Of course.,SHELDON,PENNY
16592,Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.,RAJ,HOWARD

16597,"Oh, baby, you’re killing me.",HOWARD,RAJ
16598,A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.,SHELDON,HOWARD

16600,"Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16601,Is there a problem?,OTHERS,SHELDON

16603,Hold that thought.  Hello?,HOWARD,HOWARD
16604,Thank you.,OTHERS,PENNY

16607,"You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16608,"Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16609,"Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16610,Shotgun.,SHELDON,PENNY
16611,Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?,PENNY,LEONARD
16612,The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.,SHELDON,RAJ
16613,"Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.",SHELDON,PENNY

16617,Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
16618,"Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?",OTHERS,LEONARD

16620,"Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank.",SHELDON,RAJ
16621,But after the cantina scene.,RAJ,LEONARD
16622,"Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.",PENNY,SHELDON
16623,"No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16624,But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?,SHELDON,HOWARD
16625,"Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial.",PENNY,SHELDON
16626,What are you gonna do?,PENNY,RAJ
16627,Come on. It’s okay.,LEONARD,LEONARD

16629,"Oh, but I like this computer.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16630,"Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!",RAJ,SHELDON
16631,"Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16632,Thank you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16633,You excited for Texas?,OTHERS,LEONARD
16634,"I suppose that’s possible, but for the record, I’ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.",HOWARD,LEONARD
16635,"‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16636,What do you mean?,LEONARD,RAJ
16637,"Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16638,"Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You’re welcome!",HOWARD,SHELDON

16648,I told you not to get the surgery.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16649,Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?,OTHERS,HOWARD
16650,"Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them.",HOWARD,PENNY
16651,"What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal.",LEONARD,HOWARD
16652,"Well, now, that.",SHELDON,SHELDON

16663,Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.,LEONARD,LEONARD

16666,Pchew!,SHELDON,PENNY
16667,Sure.,HOWARD,PENNY

16669,Okay.,PENNY,LEONARD
16670,What are you doing?,PENNY,PENNY
16671,"Thank you, that’s very thoughtful.",LEONARD,PENNY
16672,"Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.",SHELDON,PENNY
16673,"That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.",HOWARD,SHELDON

16680,"Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy.",RAJ,SHELDON
16681,You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16682,Yeah.,PENNY,PENNY
16683,What happened?,OTHERS,RAJ
16684,Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .,RAJ,SHELDON

16686,She feeds him out of her own mouth?,RAJ,SHELDON
16687,"Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.",LEONARD,SHELDON

16689,Hey.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16690,"Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle.",LEONARD,OTHERS

16695,"If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16696,"Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!",SHELDON,LEONARD
16697,Drat. Is this your card?,SHELDON,LEONARD
16698,May the fourth be with you?,RAJ,SHELDON
16699,Oh.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16700,That’s good quality video.,RAJ,LEONARD

16711,This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16712,I really did mean first.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16713,Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16714,We were going to have…,LEONARD,SHELDON
16715,"Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found.",RAJ,SHELDON
16716,How do you want to handle it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
16717,"Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.",HOWARD,LEONARD
16718,"Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16719,"No, it should be: why are you?",LEONARD,SHELDON
16720,"Yeah, let him do it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16721,"Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16722,I’m sorry.,LEONARD,PENNY
16723,Hey. Sorry I ditched you.,PENNY,PENNY
16724,"Yes, you do.",LEONARD,PENNY
16725,"So, are you okay?",OTHERS,LEONARD
16726,"He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?",PENNY,LEONARD
16727,That’s ridiculous.,SHELDON,HOWARD
16728,"Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?",SHELDON,LEONARD
16729,"Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?",OTHERS,LEONARD
16730,I don’t know.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16731,"All right, have a nice walk.",HOWARD,OTHERS
16732,"I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.",HOWARD,HOWARD
16733,You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.,HOWARD,PENNY
16734,"Yeah. Go ahead, open it.",LEONARD,PENNY
16735,After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16736,I know.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16737,The kids are gonna love him.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16738,"Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.",PENNY,SHELDON
16739,I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16740,Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.,RAJ,HOWARD
16741,"And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.",LEONARD,PENNY
16742,"It wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16743,"No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?",SHELDON,LEONARD
16744,No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16745,You don’t get it. I’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.,OTHERS,RAJ
16746,"Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this.",PENNY,SHELDON
16747,"Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.",RAJ,SHELDON
16748,"Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.",RAJ,LEONARD
16749,Are you gonna want to order food?,PENNY,SHELDON
16750,If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.,HOWARD,RAJ
16751,Killer robot. We built it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16752,"Hey, did I say something to upset you?",RAJ,SHELDON
16753,"Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.",SHELDON,PENNY
16754,"Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?",HOWARD,SHELDON
16755,"Howie, get off of him.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16756,"You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you.",OTHERS,PENNY
16757,I wonder why that is.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16758,That I would do to her.,LEONARD,PENNY
16759,All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16760,Oh.,PENNY,SHELDON
16761,Did you kiss him yet?,OTHERS,PENNY
16762,"I don’t know, it just died, I’m getting a bunch of static.",PENNY,PENNY
16763,Go ahead.,PENNY,SHELDON
16764,Does this mean you’re okay with me going?,OTHERS,PENNY
16765,Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.,SHELDON,PENNY
16766,"Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.",PENNY,PENNY
16767,What.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16768,Do you want to go to our place and make out?,OTHERS,HOWARD
16769,"Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?",SHELDON,RAJ
16770,Aha.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16771,Air freshener.,LEONARD,HOWARD
16772,"Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16773,For science.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16774,And I forgot to give her the message.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16775,May the force be with you. Get it?,LEONARD,SHELDON
16776,"Actually, I was thinking Leonard.",RAJ,PENNY
16777,That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?,LEONARD,PENNY
16778,Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.,LEONARD,OTHERS
16779,"Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?",SHELDON,SHELDON
16780,"No, it’s okay, it’s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.",HOWARD,OTHERS
16781,"Great, now I have to start all over.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16782,"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16783,"No, he’s bluffing.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16784,"Come on, don’t get upset.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16785,He’s not here. What’s wrong?,OTHERS,OTHERS
16786,Well now you are.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16787,"Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16788,Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16789,"The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16790,You brought your mother into this!,RAJ,SHELDON
16791,"All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16792,"All right, that’s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or…",HOWARD,OTHERS
16793,"Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper.",SHELDON,PENNY
16794,Ooh!,OTHERS,LEONARD
16795,I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?,SHELDON,OTHERS
16796,Let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.,HOWARD,LEONARD
16797,You think about dying?,PENNY,LEONARD
16798,I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16799,I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.,OTHERS,HOWARD
16800,Put it on the agenda.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16801,I’m quite sure. Good day.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16802,"Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16803,"Come on, Sheldon. Why not?",OTHERS,SHELDON
16804,"You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16805,Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16806,"Sit down, honey.",OTHERS,PENNY
16807,I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16808,"Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?",PENNY,SHELDON
16809,"It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16810,You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.,SHELDON,OTHERS
16811,So?,LEONARD,PENNY
16812,12 minutes.,RAJ,SHELDON
16813,I’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16814,"Well, I’m really happy for you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
16815,Brimstone.,SHELDON,PENNY
16816,Defend.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16817,Did that ever happen?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16818,Yeah?,PENNY,LEONARD
16819,Good night.,PENNY,SHELDON
16820,Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.,SHELDON,PENNY
16821,You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed!,SHELDON,HOWARD
16822,What?,PENNY,PENNY
16823,I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.,RAJ,PENNY
16824,"I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?",SHELDON,LEONARD
16825,"Penny, I can still drive you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16826,"There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.",OTHERS,PENNY
16827,"Let’s see, a lever, a lever.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16828,"I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.",PENNY,HOWARD
16829,Amen to that.,SHELDON,OTHERS
16830,"Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.",HOWARD,RAJ
16831,I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.,OTHERS,PENNY
16832,"Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?",RAJ,SHELDON
16833,"Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable.",LEONARD,OTHERS
16834,"Hey, Sheldon.",PENNY,HOWARD
16835,Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?,RAJ,PENNY
16836,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
16837,Sheldon’s in jail.,PENNY,LEONARD
16838,"We did them at Princeton, too.",LEONARD,PENNY
16839,Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16840,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat.",SHELDON,PENNY
16841,Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
16842,I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16843,"No, tell me.",LEONARD,OTHERS
16844,"Oh, my God! Are you…",LEONARD,PENNY
16845,"Leonard, stop pressuring me.",PENNY,PENNY
16846,"We did it! I said, we.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16847,No.,PENNY,SHELDON

16849,"Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.",SHELDON,HOWARD
16850,May what?,LEONARD,OTHERS
16851,About twenty.,PENNY,SHELDON
16852,"Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16853,Take the bus.,LEONARD,RAJ
16854,What’s with the robe?,PENNY,PENNY
16855,All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?,OTHERS,PENNY
16856,"No, thanks.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16857,Please let me be there when you tell her that.,LEONARD,LEONARD

16860,"Hey, we’re all having dinner tonight. Why don’t the two of you join us?",LEONARD,LEONARD

16862,"Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.",PENNY,LEONARD
16863,I understand. I’ll leave you be.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16864,"Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16865,Why are you telling me this now?,PENNY,SHELDON
16866,Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.,SHELDON,SHELDON
16867,I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.,OTHERS,PENNY
16868,"Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.",LEONARD,PENNY
16869,"So, how do you know he ran away?",PENNY,LEONARD
16870,What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.,SHELDON,LEONARD
16871,Congratulations.,RAJ,PENNY
16872,"No wonder they beat us, they’re jocks.",HOWARD,LEONARD
16873,Is there anything we can do?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16874,"Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.",SHELDON,LEONARD
16875,"Yeah, anything is better than this.",RAJ,LEONARD
16876,Ooh!,OTHERS,SHELDON
16877,"You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?",SHELDON,PENNY
16878,"Let me try gansta, hells no.",HOWARD,LEONARD
16879,"No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16880,How was your shower?,OTHERS,HOWARD
16881,"I’m sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people’s feelings.",OTHERS,RAJ
16882,What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.,HOWARD,SHELDON
16883,"No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.",LEONARD,HOWARD
16884,You really think so?,SHELDON,SHELDON
16885,"Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.",HOWARD,SHELDON

16904,Yeah.,RAJ,SHELDON

16913,"Sheldon, it’s me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16914,I’m a girl.,OTHERS,SHELDON
16915,"Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.",SHELDON,PENNY
16916,"I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care.",HOWARD,PENNY

16921,Really? Great.,LEONARD,SHELDON
16922,"I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.",OTHERS,SHELDON
16923,Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.,OTHERS,LEONARD

16928,Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.,LEONARD,PENNY

16982,Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16983,"We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.",LEONARD,LEONARD
16984,"Oh, God!",PENNY,SHELDON
16985,"Hey, I’m trying to help you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
16986,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
16987,"Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.",RAJ,SHELDON
16988,"See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.",PENNY,PENNY
16989,How did you get here?,RAJ,SHELDON
16990,"Oh crap, that’s terrifying.",HOWARD,SHELDON
16991,"Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?",HOWARD,SHELDON
16992,Then why am I laughing?,OTHERS,SHELDON
16993,I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.,RAJ,PENNY
16994,You called on him.,LEONARD,PENNY
16995,"What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.",PENNY,OTHERS
16996,"What, never?",PENNY,OTHERS
16997,"I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here.",OTHERS,LEONARD
16998,"Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.",SHELDON,SHELDON
16999,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
17000,Oh. Okay.,PENNY,LEONARD
17001,Yeah?,LEONARD,SHELDON
17002,You’re right. Everyone loves music.,RAJ,SHELDON
17003,But…,SHELDON,HOWARD
17004,"Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.",RAJ,SHELDON
17005,One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17006,"Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.",LEONARD,HOWARD
17007,"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.",SHELDON,HOWARD
17008,"Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?",PENNY,LEONARD
17009,Well she could have said goodbye.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17010,"So, how was work today?",OTHERS,OTHERS
17011,"Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?",HOWARD,SHELDON
17012,Let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17013,"Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.",SHELDON,PENNY
17014,"Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!",SHELDON,SHELDON
17015,I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17016,Yes. Thank you.,LEONARD,PENNY
17017,"Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.",PENNY,OTHERS
17018,"Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17019,It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?,RAJ,SHELDON
17020,Are you calling me a quitter?,SHELDON,LEONARD
17021,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
17022,"I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.",PENNY,PENNY
17023,"All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17024,Why don’t you just tell her not to come?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17025,I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.,RAJ,LEONARD
17026,"I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon.",LEONARD,PENNY
17027,"And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.",SHELDON,OTHERS
17028,Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.,SHELDON,HOWARD
17029,I don’t know.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17030,"Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.",RAJ,SHELDON
17031,Really? You’re a physicist?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17032,I doubt it.,PENNY,PENNY
17033,Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?,SHELDON,PENNY
17034,"Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17035,We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.,RAJ,PENNY
17036,Why are you here?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17037,"Actually, all I did was invite you.",LEONARD,RAJ
17038,"Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.",SHELDON,OTHERS
17039,"No, Ma! It’s Raj!",HOWARD,PENNY
17040,Excuse me?,PENNY,HOWARD
17041,Hi. There’s the little family!,PENNY,RAJ
17042,"I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?",SHELDON,LEONARD
17043,"Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…",SHELDON,SHELDON
17044,Who?,HOWARD,LEONARD
17045,"Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.",OTHERS,PENNY
17046,"Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17047,A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17048,"Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.",RAJ,SHELDON
17049,Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17050,"Well, how ’bout when you were 17?",PENNY,PENNY
17051,"If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17052,"It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.",SHELDON,RAJ
17053,Did you see The Lake House?,SHELDON,LEONARD
17054,I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?,PENNY,RAJ
17055,"But you could if you wanted to, right?",OTHERS,LEONARD
17056,"Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.",PENNY,LEONARD
17057,I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?,LEONARD,PENNY
17058,"Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17059,"Then, put on a sweater.",RAJ,PENNY
17060,"Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.",OTHERS,RAJ
17061,You because you just called him your Indian friend.,OTHERS,HOWARD
17062,Cool. Can it break Mach 1?,RAJ,SHELDON
17063,Call you back. Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17064,"Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17065,Sarcasm?,SHELDON,PENNY
17066,"Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.",RAJ,SHELDON
17067,"Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?",PENNY,SHELDON
17068,Like a gladiator!,SHELDON,SHELDON
17069,I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.,PENNY,PENNY
17070,"You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17071,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.,SHELDON,PENNY
17072,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
17073,"You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17074,I even have a screen grab on my phone.,OTHERS,PENNY
17075,"Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17076,"You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17077,"I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.",RAJ,HOWARD
17078,I have to go.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17079,"Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17080,Hey.,RAJ,SHELDON
17081,"She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17082,"Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17083,I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17084,Either.,HOWARD,OTHERS
17085,"Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.",PENNY,LEONARD
17086,"Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair?",HOWARD,SHELDON
17087,I should be so lucky.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17088,"Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?",HOWARD,RAJ
17089,No.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17090,"Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.",SHELDON,RAJ
17091,"Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.",SHELDON,PENNY
17092,Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?,PENNY,LEONARD
17093,"So, is that your team.",LEONARD,OTHERS
17094,"Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17095,That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17096,"Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.",PENNY,LEONARD
17097,"Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.",RAJ,LEONARD
17098,"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17099,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
17100,I love that one.,SHELDON,PENNY
17101,I think you’re both cute.,RAJ,SHELDON
17102,"Good night, transvestite Penny.",OTHERS,HOWARD
17103,Who.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17104,"Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.",PENNY,LEONARD
17105,Given her what?,LEONARD,PENNY
17106,Well I’m open to that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17107,You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?,PENNY,HOWARD
17108,No.,PENNY,PENNY
17109,Why?,OTHERS,SHELDON
17110,Hang on.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17111,"Hey, great.",LEONARD,HOWARD
17112,You’re not helping.,RAJ,SHELDON
17113,"Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17114,"Hey, what took you guys so long?",LEONARD,SHELDON
17115,"She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17116,No. I haven’t played the race card yet.,RAJ,SHELDON
17117,"Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?",PENNY,HOWARD
17118,All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?,RAJ,OTHERS
17119,Why would you say that?,PENNY,HOWARD
17120,You know what? This isn’t gonna work.,SHELDON,RAJ
17121,"It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.",SHELDON,PENNY
17122,"It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17123,I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17124,What exactly do you mean by that?,SHELDON,LEONARD
17125,Why not?,PENNY,LEONARD
17126,Why?,LEONARD,LEONARD
17127,I could think about you.,PENNY,LEONARD
17128,"Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.",LEONARD,RAJ
17129,"You’re talking about the painting, right?",PENNY,LEONARD
17130,"Libido 1, truth zero.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17131,"Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.",PENNY,PENNY
17132,"Okay, well, maybe not that slow.",PENNY,LEONARD
17133,"Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17134,"No, we went somewhere new.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17135,Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?,RAJ,SHELDON
17136,Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17137,"So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17138,Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17139,Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?,LEONARD,LEONARD
17140,"Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.",OTHERS,HOWARD
17141,"We made one heck of a team, huh?",SHELDON,PENNY
17142,No.,PENNY,HOWARD
17143,"Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.",SHELDON,PENNY
17144,"Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?",LEONARD,HOWARD
17145,"Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17146,Here.,SHELDON,RAJ
17147,And I will.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17148,He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17149,"Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday.",RAJ,PENNY
17150,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
17151,"But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17152,Thank you.,HOWARD,PENNY
17153,Make this interesting? You bet money on me?,PENNY,PENNY
17154,"I am not opening that door, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17155,"Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17156,"Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?",SHELDON,SHELDON
17157,He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.,RAJ,LEONARD
17158,"Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.",OTHERS,PENNY
17159,"Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I’ll do that laundry.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17160,How come you never eat broccoli?,PENNY,SHELDON
17161,How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17162,How exactly would these glasses work?,HOWARD,LEONARD
17163,"It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me.  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.",RAJ,HOWARD
17164,Gamma.,RAJ,SHELDON
17165,Smooth.,RAJ,RAJ
17166,The prospect of fried chicken.,SHELDON,PENNY
17167,"So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.",PENNY,LEONARD
17168,"No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.",PENNY,OTHERS
17169,Why?,OTHERS,LEONARD
17170,"What was it called, “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?”",PENNY,HOWARD
17171,"Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.",PENNY,SHELDON
17172,"I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17173,Not really.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17174,"No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17175,Morning.,LEONARD,HOWARD
17176,That’s nice.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17177,"She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?",SHELDON,RAJ
17178,"I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17179,"Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.",RAJ,SHELDON
17180,Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17181,You’re welcome.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17182,"I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17183,"Oh, boy.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17184,I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17185,It’s paprika.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17186,What are you doing here?,LEONARD,LEONARD
17187,How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17188,"Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17189,You’re blowing this for me!,RAJ,PENNY
17190,You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17191,"Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?",SHELDON,LEONARD
17192,How does that work?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17193,"Oh, but what about the party?",PENNY,LEONARD
17194,"Great, then we’ll get married, I won’t be able to talk to her, and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.",RAJ,LEONARD
17195,But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.,SHELDON,PENNY
17196,Nothing. Everything’s fine.,HOWARD,HOWARD
17197,Kiss-ass.,HOWARD,RAJ
17198,"Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?",PENNY,LEONARD
17199,Well you got me out of my pants.,SHELDON,PENNY
17200,"Okay. Well, good night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17201,"Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17202,"Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17203,"Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17204,I said I’ll get to it.,PENNY,HOWARD
17205,I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.,LEONARD,HOWARD
17206,"Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17207,"Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17208,I didn’t want to make this one.,RAJ,PENNY
17209,"Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17210,I’m an engineer. Most engineers don’t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17211,Let’s box it up.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17212,You can only ask one question.,PENNY,SHELDON
17213,I need soup.,SHELDON,HOWARD
17214,Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17215,Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.,OTHERS,OTHERS
17216,Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.,OTHERS,PENNY
17217,I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17218,"I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17219,What’s wrong?,OTHERS,OTHERS
17220,Okay.,RAJ,SHELDON
17221,"No, it vibrates. Keep going.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17222,Gonna be a long night.,LEONARD,LEONARD

17224,Let me finish.,RAJ,PENNY
17225,"Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?",OTHERS,SHELDON
17226,"Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.",PENNY,SHELDON
17227,Basket weaving at the craft museum.,OTHERS,RAJ
17228,No.,LEONARD,OTHERS
17229,"Sheldon, that’s my water.",RAJ,SHELDON
17230,"You okay in there, bestie?",OTHERS,PENNY
17231,"In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17232,What? That was ambiguous.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17233,You know I don’t drink.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17234,"So, what should we talk about?",OTHERS,PENNY
17235,I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17236,"Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17237,"Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.",PENNY,SHELDON
17238,Where’s Penny?,LEONARD,RAJ
17239,"Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?",SHELDON,SHELDON
17240,"With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17241,Okay.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17242,"Okay, wait…",PENNY,HOWARD
17243,"Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.",LEONARD,HOWARD
17244,"Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17245,Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.,OTHERS,HOWARD
17246,"Maybe next week, we could all get together.",OTHERS,OTHERS
17247,"I’ll walk you to your car. You’re in structure 3 level C, right?",HOWARD,SHELDON
17248,Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17249,So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?,LEONARD,LEONARD
17250,So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17251,You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17252,My credibility may have been damaged…,SHELDON,HOWARD
17253,"Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.",RAJ,SHELDON
17254,"Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17255,"Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17256,I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17257,"No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17258,"Well, where the hell’s the coin?",PENNY,SHELDON
17259,Okay.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17260,Give me the phone.,HOWARD,HOWARD

17264,How would I be blinded?,LEONARD,SHELDON
17265,"Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.",PENNY,SHELDON
17266,Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17267,"And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17268,"I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.",LEONARD,PENNY
17269,"Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?",LEONARD,LEONARD
17270,"Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.",PENNY,PENNY
17271,"Oh, great.",HOWARD,PENNY

17273,Sure.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17274,Seriously?,LEONARD,LEONARD
17275,Of course you must.,LEONARD,SHELDON

17277,Three.,RAJ,PENNY
17278,Very well. How do you propose we move forward?,SHELDON,SHELDON

17280,"Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?",PENNY,RAJ
17281,"Hey, Sheldon?",LEONARD,SHELDON
17282,"W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17283,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?",PENNY,LEONARD
17284,Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.,PENNY,LEONARD
17285,Who are you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17286,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17287,"Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win.  B-But we didn’t finish.",SHELDON,PENNY
17288,"You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.",HOWARD,SHELDON

17292,"Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?",OTHERS,LEONARD
17293,"Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?",LEONARD,SHELDON
17294,"Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17295,"It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?",SHELDON,SHELDON
17296,"Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.",RAJ,LEONARD
17297,You sure?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17298,"We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17299,You’re leaving?,LEONARD,SHELDON
17300,What are you doing?,SHELDON,RAJ

17303,"Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?",PENNY,LEONARD
17304,"Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?",OTHERS,PENNY
17305,I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?,LEONARD,HOWARD
17306,Nothing.,PENNY,SHELDON
17307,"Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17308,"Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17309,You lucky duck.,HOWARD,HOWARD
17310,"Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.",RAJ,LEONARD
17311,"Oh, my God. It’s working.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17312,It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.,SHELDON,PENNY
17313,"Oh, okay, Leonard?",RAJ,SHELDON
17314,"Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17315,"We don’t have an appointment. We, we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17316,No.,SHELDON,HOWARD
17317,"Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17318,"After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17319,"Well, now do you see the problem?",SHELDON,LEONARD
17320,"Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17321,My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.,RAJ,SHELDON
17322,"Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17323,"Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17324,"Howard, just come in here.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17325,Two-headed tiger.,OTHERS,RAJ
17326,"Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.",OTHERS,PENNY
17327,"So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?",SHELDON,LEONARD
17328,"I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17329,"Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17330,"Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.",SHELDON,HOWARD
17331,"Trying to have a magical night here, guys.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17332,Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?,RAJ,LEONARD
17333,"You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17334,Give me that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17335,"Yes we did, I just came from it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17336,But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17337,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17338,"Is not. Is not, is not.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17339,"Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?",PENNY,PENNY
17340,And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17341,"Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?",LEONARD,SHELDON
17342,"Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17343,"Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.",OTHERS,PENNY
17344,"Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.",LEONARD,OTHERS
17345,Yeah?,PENNY,HOWARD
17346,Here comes another contraction.,OTHERS,PENNY
17347,"Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.",RAJ,HOWARD
17348,"I’m sorry, go ahead.",PENNY,OTHERS
17349,It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17350,When’s the screening?,LEONARD,OTHERS
17351,"Well, I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.",PENNY,LEONARD
17352,"Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress.",PENNY,SHELDON
17353,"Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17354,All right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17355,"Hey, guys.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17356,Oh.,HOWARD,SHELDON

17362,"Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.",RAJ,SHELDON
17363,"Fine, go ahead.",PENNY,PENNY
17364,It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.,SHELDON,OTHERS
17365,This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.,HOWARD,SHELDON

17370,"Leonard, wait.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17371,"It means after we play handball, I’m showering at home.",HOWARD,SHELDON

17376,Why?,OTHERS,LEONARD
17377,"Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.",RAJ,HOWARD

17381,Sorry.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17382,"So, what do you guys want to do?",RAJ,SHELDON
17383,Why on Earth would we have sex?,SHELDON,PENNY
17384,"Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17385,Damn.,PENNY,LEONARD
17386,"Aw, that movie’s so cute.",OTHERS,SHELDON

17400,"What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?",HOWARD,LEONARD
17401,"No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.",SHELDON,SHELDON

17428,I got a splinter.,SHELDON,HOWARD
17429,"Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.",LEONARD,PENNY

17433,You’re not changing how Penny laughs.,LEONARD,SHELDON

17435,"Uh, I don’t, any day now.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17436,"I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.",OTHERS,SHELDON

17793,"Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.",HOWARD,PENNY
17794,"Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what’s up?",PENNY,RAJ
17795,"Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.",LEONARD,HOWARD
17796,Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17797,Say you’re sorry.,PENNY,SHELDON
17798,"Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17799,Oh. I like the idea of being tall.,OTHERS,PENNY
17800,"I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant.",OTHERS,PENNY
17801,Think they’ll break up?,OTHERS,SHELDON
17802,"Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close.",RAJ,LEONARD
17803,"Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?",LEONARD,SHELDON
17804,"Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17805,Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…,HOWARD,SHELDON
17806,"Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.",RAJ,SHELDON
17807,"‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife.",RAJ,LEONARD
17808,No.,OTHERS,PENNY
17809,"Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17810,"Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.",RAJ,LEONARD
17811,You took ballet?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17812,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17813,Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17814,Thought I heard you out here.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17815,I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17816,Was it working?,OTHERS,SHELDON
17817,Relax.,PENNY,LEONARD
17818,Yeah. What did they say?,LEONARD,SHELDON
17819,Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.,SHELDON,PENNY
17820,You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it.,OTHERS,PENNY
17821,Thank you. And it’s figs.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17822,Sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.,HOWARD,HOWARD
17823,Almost 6:30.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17824,About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!,SHELDON,PENNY
17825,This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.,OTHERS,OTHERS
17826,"Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17827,"Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17828,"Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.",RAJ,LEONARD
17829,"I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17830,"You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17831,Just wait.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17832,Not this time.,LEONARD,LEONARD
17833,"Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17834,"Hear, hear.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17835,"Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.",HOWARD,HOWARD
17836,This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.,SHELDON,RAJ
17837,You can’t take that personally.,HOWARD,PENNY
17838,Nuts to that. What else you got?,SHELDON,PENNY
17839,You don’t sound very confident.,OTHERS,OTHERS
17840,Do you want to do this or not?,RAJ,PENNY
17841,What do you mean?,LEONARD,SHELDON
17842,We do?,SHELDON,PENNY
17843,"Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.",PENNY,OTHERS
17844,Sure.,PENNY,LEONARD
17845,"So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me.",OTHERS,OTHERS
17846,"No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.",SHELDON,HOWARD
17847,"It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.",RAJ,LEONARD
17848,"Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?  Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I’m gonna break the door down!  Son of a bitch! Ma, help!",HOWARD,PENNY
17849,Aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17850,"Okay, how do we catch it?",LEONARD,SHELDON
17851,Oh. Thank you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17852,Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.,RAJ,LEONARD
17853,They have them every week.,PENNY,LEONARD
17854,Five months ago.,OTHERS,HOWARD
17855,"Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.",RAJ,LEONARD
17856,"Well, I don’t like it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17857,You’re in your bedroom.,LEONARD,OTHERS
17858,"So, here we are. Back in bed together.",LEONARD,PENNY
17859,"In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.",SHELDON,HOWARD
17860,Hey. Nice sweater.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17861,Got it.,PENNY,RAJ
17862,I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17863,There goes our shot at him living on the roof.,LEONARD,PENNY
17864,All right.,SHELDON,HOWARD
17865,"Ah, cool.",PENNY,HOWARD
17866,Sheldon.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17867,Do you have any alcohol?,PENNY,HOWARD
17868,Hey.,RAJ,PENNY
17869,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.,PENNY,PENNY
17870,"H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?",LEONARD,PENNY
17871,So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.,SHELDON,SHELDON
17872,"All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right",SHELDON,PENNY
17873,I’m signing off now.,RAJ,LEONARD
17874,"Oh, it’s fun.",PENNY,LEONARD
17875,Ready to get started?,PENNY,PENNY
17876,Jews don’t have heaven.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17877,"Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17878,When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?,RAJ,PENNY
17879,They’re just doing a background check on me.,HOWARD,PENNY
17880,"Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.",RAJ,LEONARD
17881,"Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17882,"So, that’s Stephanie, huh?",PENNY,SHELDON
17883,Will you go with me?,PENNY,SHELDON
17884,Did they make a movie about it?,PENNY,LEONARD
17885,"Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.",HOWARD,RAJ
17886,"Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?",PENNY,SHELDON
17887,"No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?",SHELDON,PENNY
17888,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17889,Eww.,PENNY,LEONARD
17890,"S’mores, huh? Good for you.",LEONARD,HOWARD
17891,They’re coming to America… ♪,OTHERS,LEONARD
17892,I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.,PENNY,PENNY
17893,It’s called proving a point.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17894,So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?,HOWARD,LEONARD
17895,"I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?",OTHERS,SHELDON
17896,Like who?,PENNY,HOWARD
17897,Where?,OTHERS,LEONARD
17898,Fine.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17899,"Okay, so, what’s new with you guys.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17900,"Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?",PENNY,PENNY
17901,Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?,PENNY,PENNY
17902,"Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?",LEONARD,PENNY
17903,Sure. What is it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
17904,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17905,"Yep, pretty sure.",OTHERS,RAJ
17906,"I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17907,"Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17908,Did you protest?,SHELDON,LEONARD
17909,You got Penny to sign up for online dating?,LEONARD,LEONARD
17910,They complete my ensemble. What do you want?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17911,I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17912,He asked her during coitus.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17913,"Man, I’m worn out.",RAJ,LEONARD
17914,Oh. What’d she say?,OTHERS,PENNY
17915,"That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?",OTHERS,PENNY
17916,"Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.",PENNY,HOWARD
17917,"I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17918,"Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17919,"Aw, crap. Let’s go.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17920,"Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought.",SHELDON,PENNY
17921,"Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?",SHELDON,SHELDON
17922,"Oh, Leslie, thank God.",HOWARD,LEONARD
17923,"Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?",PENNY,LEONARD
17924,"Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup.",OTHERS,PENNY
17925,Sure. We’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?,OTHERS,LEONARD
17926,"Oh, fun. Like a play date.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17927,"Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17928,No.,LEONARD,PENNY
17929,Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17930,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,LEONARD
17931,"No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.",RAJ,SHELDON
17932,"No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.",LEONARD,PENNY
17933,"Well, hang on. What movie is it?",HOWARD,LEONARD
17934,"Me, too.",RAJ,LEONARD
17935,"Okay, I know what you’re doing.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17936,"Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17937,"Hey, look who’s come out….",HOWARD,LEONARD
17938,"What do you mean, yes?",HOWARD,SHELDON
17939,Darn! She found me!,SHELDON,LEONARD
17940,Apologize.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17941,"Wait, you don’t want me to go?",PENNY,HOWARD
17942,"Pressure. I mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.",PENNY,LEONARD
17943,She got lucky.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17944,No. Amy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
17945,"You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.",HOWARD,SHELDON
17946,"Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17947,"Dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name.",RAJ,SHELDON
17948,"Oh, you know, he’s good.",PENNY,SHELDON
17949,I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did.,OTHERS,PENNY
17950,"Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business.",OTHERS,LEONARD
17951,Aha! So I am working with you.,RAJ,OTHERS
17952,"No, just keep walking.",PENNY,SHELDON
17953,"Please, don’t go there, Howard.",LEONARD,LEONARD
17954,We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?,LEONARD,OTHERS
17955,"Oh, sure. Let me see it.",PENNY,SHELDON
17956,Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17957,Should we do something for her?,OTHERS,RAJ
17958,"Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.",PENNY,OTHERS
17959,"Oh, but he said you can get store credit.",OTHERS,RAJ
17960,Hi. We’d like to volunteer.,OTHERS,SHELDON
17961,"Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking.",OTHERS,PENNY
17962,How is that possible?,HOWARD,SHELDON
17963,"Okay, well, what do you communicate about?",PENNY,SHELDON
17964,"No, you do not.",PENNY,LEONARD
17965,"Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17966,"I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.",PENNY,LEONARD
17967,Where you going?,PENNY,PENNY
17968,You take that back.,SHELDON,LEONARD
17969,"Don’t you dare, missy.",LEONARD,PENNY
17970,"All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.",SHELDON,HOWARD
17971,"If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.",SHELDON,PENNY
17972,"It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she’d also denied him Christmas he’d be a little better at it.",SHELDON,PENNY
17973,"I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
17974,"Hey, we’re here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17975,"Nope, this is my proud face.",OTHERS,SHELDON
17976,"Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.",RAJ,SHELDON
17977,"Well, that’s not acceptable. I mean, I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.",SHELDON,PENNY
17978,"Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!",SHELDON,OTHERS
17979,Gelatinous Sphere.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17980,I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?,SHELDON,OTHERS
17981,"I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17982,"But, that’s Star Wars Day.",SHELDON,OTHERS
17983,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.",OTHERS,HOWARD
17984,"Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.",RAJ,SHELDON
17985,"Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.",SHELDON,PENNY
17986,The what?,PENNY,RAJ
17987,"Blue, as in depressed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
17988,So I can shoot you with a spitball.,HOWARD,SHELDON
17989,"I know, and Amy says I can’t have a train room.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17990,"If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.",PENNY,RAJ
17991,Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?,HOWARD,LEONARD
17992,"Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.",SHELDON,LEONARD
17993,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
17994,Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17995,"Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.",RAJ,PENNY
17996,Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.,OTHERS,LEONARD
17997,"The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.",LEONARD,SHELDON
17998,Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.,HOWARD,LEONARD
17999,Sheldon threw us all under the bus.,LEONARD,PENNY
18000,"Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.",LEONARD,OTHERS
18001,"Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?",RAJ,PENNY
18002,What about it?,HOWARD,PENNY
18003,"Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.",HOWARD,SHELDON
18004,"No, no not at all. A little bit.",LEONARD,SHELDON
18005,Of course.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18006,"Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.",SHELDON,RAJ
18007,When is it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
18008,"Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.",OTHERS,PENNY
18009,Smile.,PENNY,SHELDON
18010,No.,SHELDON,HOWARD
18011,Penny’s not answering my texts.,LEONARD,LEONARD
18012,This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.,SHELDON,SHELDON
18013,Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.,LEONARD,HOWARD
18014,"Yes, no and no.",LEONARD,HOWARD
18015,"Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall.",OTHERS,SHELDON
18016,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?,SHELDON,LEONARD
18017,Sir.,LEONARD,LEONARD
18018,Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?,HOWARD,LEONARD
18019,"No, here.",HOWARD,PENNY
18020,Sheldon and I are living together.,OTHERS,SHELDON
18021,What a waste of time.,OTHERS,HOWARD
18022,Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.,SHELDON,SHELDON
18023,"Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?",PENNY,LEONARD
18024,"Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.",SHELDON,PENNY
18025,"Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18026,"Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable.",SHELDON,RAJ
18027,Hey.,RAJ,LEONARD
18028,"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18029,"May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?",SHELDON,HOWARD
18030,In my fanny pack.,RAJ,HOWARD
18031,You’re nitpicking.,LEONARD,PENNY
18032,It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.,PENNY,LEONARD
18033,Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.,HOWARD,PENNY
18034,"What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18035,"Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.",LEONARD,SHELDON
18036,But.,SHELDON,HOWARD
18037,"Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!",OTHERS,HOWARD
18038,"If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.",RAJ,LEONARD
18039,"Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!",OTHERS,LEONARD
18040,It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.,OTHERS,SHELDON
18041,"In a word, triumphant.",LEONARD,LEONARD
18042,"Oh, this just might be your lucky day.",LEONARD,SHELDON
18043,"Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.",SHELDON,LEONARD
18044,"Oh, so many crazy rules.",SHELDON,OTHERS
18045,"No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.",PENNY,SHELDON
18046,"No, you didn’t.",OTHERS,LEONARD
18047,All right. What do you think is happening?,PENNY,RAJ
18048,Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.,SHELDON,PENNY
18049,"You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.",PENNY,SHELDON
18050,"Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.",RAJ,SHELDON
18051,You see where I’m going with this.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18052,"You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
18053,I should’ve known.,HOWARD,LEONARD
18054,I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.,HOWARD,RAJ
18055,Sheldon?  What are you doing?!,LEONARD,LEONARD
18056,"Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.",SHELDON,HOWARD
18057,"All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.",PENNY,LEONARD
18058,"No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!",LEONARD,SHELDON
18059,"Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?",OTHERS,LEONARD

18084,Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?,LEONARD,LEONARD
18085,"Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.",HOWARD,SHELDON

18100,"Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?",OTHERS,LEONARD
18101,I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18102,Nope. It’s pretty exciting.,LEONARD,SHELDON
18103,"Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.",SHELDON,HOWARD
18104,"Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18105,"I was beating him so bad, he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?",SHELDON,SHELDON

18113,He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.,PENNY,LEONARD

18130,Did you at least have a good flight down there?,LEONARD,SHELDON
18131,Get out of my spot.,HOWARD,SHELDON
18132,"You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.",SHELDON,PENNY
18133,I still don’t like this cushion.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18134,"So they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them.",SHELDON,LEONARD
18135,"You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.",PENNY,RAJ
18136,"Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18137,"Okay, let’s try this one. Spherical Hankel function.",HOWARD,LEONARD

18150,Was that a flask?,LEONARD,LEONARD
18151,"Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.",OTHERS,PENNY
18152,Kind of busy right now.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18153,The word is forbade.,LEONARD,SHELDON
18154,Thank you.,RAJ,RAJ

18158,"Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?",LEONARD,SHELDON
18159,"So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.",SHELDON,LEONARD
18160,"Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.",HOWARD,PENNY
18161,"Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today.",HOWARD,PENNY
18162,Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.,PENNY,PENNY
18163,Sheldon.,PENNY,SHELDON
18164,"What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?",SHELDON,PENNY
18165,"No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.",SHELDON,LEONARD
18166,Yes.,PENNY,PENNY

18177,"Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?",PENNY,SHELDON

18179,I need to speak to you.,SHELDON,HOWARD
18180,"Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.",SHELDON,RAJ
18181,"When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.",SHELDON,OTHERS

18183,"If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.",HOWARD,SHELDON

18191,"Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?",LEONARD,LEONARD
18192,"Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.",RAJ,PENNY
18193,Very much.,LEONARD,PENNY
18194,But you won’t need much for that.,SHELDON,HOWARD
18195,"No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.",SHELDON,LEONARD

18208,Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.,SHELDON,PENNY
18209,"Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?",PENNY,LEONARD
18210,Hey.,SHELDON,SHELDON

18212,Do you want the fire extinguisher?,LEONARD,LEONARD
18213,"What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?",OTHERS,LEONARD

18222,Exactly.,SHELDON,SHELDON
18223,Why does Leonard get to go?,SHELDON,HOWARD
18224,I did like that he had the weather on it.,LEONARD,HOWARD

18237,But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?,PENNY,SHELDON
18238,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
18239,"No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.",LEONARD,OTHERS
18240,"I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?",SHELDON,SHELDON
18241,"Stop. We can’t do this, it’s not right.",SHELDON,RAJ
18242,"I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.",RAJ,HOWARD

18424,What are you doing here?,LEONARD,HOWARD
18425,"Well, good for him.",RAJ,HOWARD

18469,"Oh, yeah",HOWARD,SHELDON
18470,"No, just sit here.",LEONARD,PENNY

18892,"If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?",LEONARD,HOWARD
18893,I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.,SHELDON,SHELDON
18894,What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?,RAJ,PENNY
18895,Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18896,So busy.,PENNY,HOWARD
18897,"That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any more.",HOWARD,LEONARD
18898,"Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18899,"Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying.",HOWARD,SHELDON
18900,You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?,RAJ,LEONARD
18901,"It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.",SHELDON,PENNY
18902,My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?,OTHERS,SHELDON
18903,"Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?",PENNY,SHELDON
18904,"I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!",OTHERS,OTHERS
18905,"Well, the evidence does support that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
18906,I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.,SHELDON,OTHERS
18907,Aren’t you gonna ask?,LEONARD,LEONARD
18908,Penny.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18909,Were you drunk?,LEONARD,HOWARD

18911,Lucky?,HOWARD,SHELDON
18912,Yeah. What about it?,HOWARD,SHELDON
18913,I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.,HOWARD,PENNY
18914,Housekeeping.,OTHERS,LEONARD

18916,That’s not true.,OTHERS,RAJ

18922,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.,LEONARD,RAJ
18923,What do you say?,OTHERS,RAJ
18924,"Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.",RAJ,SHELDON
18925,But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.,OTHERS,LEONARD
18926,"Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line.",LEONARD,SHELDON
18927,"Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?  Leonard, I am your father.",PENNY,LEONARD
18928,I don’t get it.,PENNY,SHELDON
18929,"Uh, it’s more complicated than that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
18930,"For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.",OTHERS,SHELDON
18931,"Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.",OTHERS,LEONARD

18938,"Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.",PENNY,PENNY
18939,Yes. Why do you ask?,SHELDON,SHELDON
18940,Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.,OTHERS,PENNY
18941,"Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.",LEONARD,SHELDON
18942,That’s where Sheldon sits.,LEONARD,HOWARD
18943,"Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…",LEONARD,PENNY
18944,"What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?",HOWARD,HOWARD
18945,What’s going on? How’d I get here?,SHELDON,SHELDON
18946,"Let’s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector’s meet and greet.",OTHERS,LEONARD
18947,I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.,HOWARD,SHELDON

18949,"Ooh, I don’t like where this is going.",RAJ,PENNY
18950,I have to go.,SHELDON,PENNY
18951,"So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?",PENNY,RAJ
18952,"Okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.",HOWARD,LEONARD

18955,"Dun, dun, dun. He started it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
18956,"Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.",RAJ,SHELDON
18957,Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?,RAJ,SHELDON
18958,"Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry.",RAJ,SHELDON
18959,"No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.",LEONARD,PENNY
18960,Go ahead.,LEONARD,SHELDON
18961,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
18962,We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?,LEONARD,HOWARD
18963,"No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick.",HOWARD,SHELDON
18964,Nary an argument? Nary?,LEONARD,OTHERS
18965,I can’t do that.,LEONARD,LEONARD
18966,It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.,RAJ,PENNY
18967,So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?,OTHERS,SHELDON
18968,Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.,HOWARD,SHELDON

18974,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.,SHELDON,LEONARD
18975,"Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.",SHELDON,PENNY
18976,"Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.",SHELDON,PENNY
18977,"Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.",PENNY,LEONARD

18980,Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.,HOWARD,RAJ
18981,"Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.",OTHERS,SHELDON
18982,Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.,LEONARD,PENNY
18983,"You did talk to her, didn’t you?",OTHERS,SHELDON
18984,That’s the beauty of it.,SHELDON,PENNY
18985,I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
18986,I once looked in Sheldon’s underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.,OTHERS,LEONARD
18987,How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.,LEONARD,SHELDON
18988,Fine.,HOWARD,SHELDON
18989,I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.,SHELDON,PENNY
18990,Please don’t.,OTHERS,HOWARD
18991,"Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?",SHELDON,LEONARD
18992,And how many guys have you gone out with?,OTHERS,LEONARD
18993,I know.,HOWARD,SHELDON
18994,It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.,PENNY,LEONARD
18995,We were up to you.,LEONARD,PENNY
18996,"I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?",SHELDON,SHELDON
18997,Sorry. How did it go?,LEONARD,HOWARD

19000,That one? Damn right I like that one.,LEONARD,SHELDON
19001,Hi.,LEONARD,HOWARD

19005,"Thank you. Hello, neighbour.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19006,I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.,OTHERS,LEONARD
19007,"But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?",SHELDON,SHELDON
19008,"No, it’s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.",PENNY,SHELDON
19009,"Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.",SHELDON,LEONARD

19011,This trip to India sounds fun.,OTHERS,SHELDON

19013,Harry and Ginny get together?,LEONARD,LEONARD
19014,"Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.",SHELDON,SHELDON

19019,That’s funny. Let’s do that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
19020,Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19021,"Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19022,"Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.",SHELDON,LEONARD

19027,"Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.",SHELDON,LEONARD

19051,"Aw, thank you.",PENNY,PENNY
19052,Why would you say that?,PENNY,PENNY

19166,Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?,LEONARD,HOWARD
19167,"The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19168,My mother was right. Hell is real.,SHELDON,RAJ
19169,Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19170,You’re right. Oh! I should do this.,HOWARD,SHELDON

19178,"That’s very generous, Sheldon.",HOWARD,LEONARD

19180,Sheldon. Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
19181,"Greetings, whatever the hell you are.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19182,So the point is I may have saved her life.,PENNY,SHELDON

19184,Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.,SHELDON,LEONARD

19186,"Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19187,For me.,SHELDON,SHELDON

19216,That presupposes Penny is tense.,SHELDON,LEONARD

19218,"All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.",SHELDON,PENNY

19220,I saw a picture of you two dancing together.,OTHERS,SHELDON

19253,Excuse me?,HOWARD,HOWARD
19254,Didn’t see it? What were you doing?,HOWARD,LEONARD
19255,"No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.",OTHERS,PENNY

19291,It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.,SHELDON,PENNY

19309,"Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.",HOWARD,SHELDON
19310,Sounds like your neighbour’s home.,HOWARD,SHELDON

19312,"Yeah. Sack up, dude.",RAJ,RAJ
19313,What’s going on?,LEONARD,LEONARD

19337,"Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.",PENNY,HOWARD

19346,I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.,RAJ,SHELDON
19347,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,HOWARD

19365,I was not aware of that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19366,"Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.",HOWARD,SHELDON

19371,Just a whole lot of Afrin.,LEONARD,PENNY

19377,"He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.",SHELDON,PENNY
19378,"Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.",RAJ,LEONARD

19396,"He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?",PENNY,HOWARD
19397,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.,SHELDON,LEONARD

19435,Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19436,You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19437,That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.,OTHERS,HOWARD
19438,Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19439,I will yield.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19440,"All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment.",PENNY,LEONARD
19441,"What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19442,Give him what he wants or we’re done.,OTHERS,SHELDON
19443,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19444,That was incredible.,HOWARD,LEONARD
19445,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.,RAJ,LEONARD
19446,"I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.",PENNY,LEONARD
19447,Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?,PENNY,SHELDON
19448,Didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?,LEONARD,SHELDON
19449,"Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?",LEONARD,LEONARD
19450,"Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!",PENNY,PENNY
19451,Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.,SHELDON,HOWARD
19452,"Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point.",SHELDON,HOWARD
19453,You’re a putz. You know what that means?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19454,What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?,RAJ,HOWARD
19455,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
19456,"But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19457,Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19458,"Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?",HOWARD,HOWARD
19459,"Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.",SHELDON,PENNY
19460,"I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?",OTHERS,PENNY
19461,"No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.",SHELDON,PENNY
19462,"Hey, Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?",PENNY,OTHERS
19463,And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19464,No.,LEONARD,PENNY
19465,"Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character.",PENNY,SHELDON
19466,"Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19467,"A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.",HOWARD,SHELDON
19468,"On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19469,"Yeah, okay, no.",PENNY,PENNY
19470,The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19471,"You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.",HOWARD,HOWARD
19472,Should we invite Raj?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19473,"Yep, you’re mad.",SHELDON,PENNY
19474,I’m so glad we could work this all out.,RAJ,SHELDON
19475,I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.,HOWARD,LEONARD
19476,Okay. And when would that be?,LEONARD,RAJ
19477,What was that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
19478,"Yeah, okay, Howard wins.",RAJ,PENNY
19479,"Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19480,"Hey, what’s your problem?",RAJ,SHELDON
19481,I don’t know. Maybe.,LEONARD,SHELDON
19482,"What do you mean, vastly wealthy?",PENNY,SHELDON
19483,Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?,OTHERS,HOWARD
19484,"Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.",PENNY,SHELDON
19485,"Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.",RAJ,LEONARD
19486,Said Pharoah to Moses.,SHELDON,OTHERS
19487,"Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?",SHELDON,LEONARD
19488,"All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.",PENNY,SHELDON
19489,"Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19490,"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19491,"Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse.",LEONARD,PENNY
19492,And you want me to return it for you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19493,Hi.,LEONARD,SHELDON
19494,Be grateful I’m still in the room.,SHELDON,HOWARD
19495,He never went back to the university?,RAJ,SHELDON
19496,"Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.",HOWARD,LEONARD
19497,No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.,PENNY,SHELDON
19498,Really?,PENNY,LEONARD
19499,"The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19500,Where are you moving?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19501,and this wine is why.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19502,So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?,OTHERS,PENNY
19503,Sorry we’re late.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19504,"Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.",RAJ,LEONARD
19505,Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.,RAJ,SHELDON
19506,How is this any different?,OTHERS,PENNY
19507,I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.,OTHERS,RAJ
19508,Mmm. So what do you need help with?,PENNY,HOWARD
19509,"Howard, he’s fifteen.",LEONARD,PENNY
19510,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19511,"Oh, thanks for asking until I did.",PENNY,PENNY
19512,"Ooh, that sounds like fun.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19513,"I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.",SHELDON,PENNY
19514,"Oh, sure. Please join us.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19515,Amy.  Amy.  Amy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19516,Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?,SHELDON,PENNY
19517,Oh. Immature.,OTHERS,PENNY
19518,Hi.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19519,So how’s work?,LEONARD,OTHERS
19520,"Okay, what kind of soup do you want.",PENNY,SHELDON
19521,"Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19522,"It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19523,"You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19524,What do you two talk about?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19525,"Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19526,"You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up.",LEONARD,PENNY
19527,"No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.",PENNY,SHELDON
19528,Leonard?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19529,No one’s saying that. Let’s go.,PENNY,SHELDON
19530,Something wrong?,OTHERS,PENNY
19531,You want some tea?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19532,Busting you.,RAJ,PENNY
19533,And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.,OTHERS,SHELDON
19534,"Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19535,Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?,SHELDON,PENNY
19536,You’re a real douche.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19537,"I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.",SHELDON,RAJ
19538,It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!,OTHERS,LEONARD
19539,"Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.",LEONARD,RAJ
19540,I guess you’re right. See you later.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19541,"I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking.",SHELDON,PENNY
19542,"When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.",OTHERS,LEONARD
19543,"To my bones. I mean, I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.",LEONARD,PENNY
19544,"No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19545,"He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19546,"Obviously, not a cleaning business.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19547,We are going to find out.,RAJ,HOWARD
19548,"Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19549,Your problem.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19550,"I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party.",SHELDON,HOWARD
19551,You have a Batsuit.,OTHERS,OTHERS
19552,"If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.",HOWARD,SHELDON
19553,"All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…",OTHERS,SHELDON
19554,"Please, I’m working.",HOWARD,LEONARD
19555,It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.,OTHERS,PENNY
19556,Why do you think I told him to come to your place?,HOWARD,LEONARD
19557,"Okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…",PENNY,HOWARD
19558,"Please, I’m asking you as a friend.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19559,Here’s some champagne.,PENNY,HOWARD
19560,"All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.",LEONARD,PENNY
19561,Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19562,"It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.",PENNY,SHELDON
19563,"Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.",LEONARD,SHELDON
19564,Thanks for pointing it out.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19565,"Oh, my God, what happened?",PENNY,LEONARD
19566,"Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19567,"I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so.",SHELDON,PENNY
19568,Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19569,"Ooh, please do, Rajesh.",OTHERS,HOWARD
19570,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19571,Interrupting physicist.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19572,Then no.,PENNY,PENNY
19573,"Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19574,"So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?",SHELDON,SHELDON
19575,Really? You have a piercing gun?,OTHERS,PENNY
19576,"Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19577,"No doubt, sign here.",RAJ,LEONARD
19578,"No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!",HOWARD,HOWARD
19579,What happened?,OTHERS,HOWARD
19580,You couldn’t sleep either?,PENNY,LEONARD
19581,Hello? What is this?,LEONARD,PENNY
19582,"Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad.",RAJ,SHELDON
19583,"Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.",LEONARD,PENNY
19584,I’m taking you home.,RAJ,LEONARD
19585,"I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto.",SHELDON,RAJ
19586,"That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19587,I don’t care.,SHELDON,HOWARD
19588,"Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19589,Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19590,"There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19591,What are you waiting for? Hit send.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19592,"Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.",RAJ,LEONARD
19593,Is that so?,PENNY,LEONARD
19594,"Okay, it’s your game. You go first.",PENNY,LEONARD
19595,Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19596,"Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.",RAJ,SHELDON
19597,"Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back.",HOWARD,OTHERS
19598,Okay.,RAJ,SHELDON
19599,Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.,OTHERS,SHELDON
19600,On oatmeal day?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19601,"She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19602,"Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you.",OTHERS,PENNY
19603,I don’t understand.,LEONARD,SHELDON
19604,"Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.",LEONARD,PENNY
19605,Sounds great!,RAJ,PENNY
19606,"I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true.",SHELDON,PENNY
19607,"What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?",OTHERS,SHELDON
19608,You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.,HOWARD,LEONARD
19609,Really? Who?,LEONARD,RAJ
19610,"Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens.",PENNY,LEONARD
19611,"Well, that was quite a day.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19612,Just wanted to see how the guidance system’s coming along.,OTHERS,HOWARD
19613,"Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19614,And it’s done.,RAJ,SHELDON
19615,Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19616,"Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.",RAJ,PENNY
19617,"Yes. I did good, right?",OTHERS,PENNY
19618,Where did you go to school?,LEONARD,HOWARD
19619,I think I swallowed some paint!,RAJ,SHELDON
19620,"Alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner.",PENNY,OTHERS
19621,What was I supposed to tell her?,LEONARD,LEONARD
19622,Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?,SHELDON,SHELDON
19623,Great.,RAJ,LEONARD
19624,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19625,"Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.",PENNY,PENNY
19626,Will Wil want it?,LEONARD,PENNY
19627,What is the problem?,PENNY,RAJ
19628,"Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19629,"Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.",SHELDON,HOWARD
19630,"Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.",OTHERS,LEONARD
19631,"Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19632,"Oh, it’s cute.",PENNY,LEONARD
19633,I’m your best friend?,PENNY,SHELDON
19634,"Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.",HOWARD,SHELDON
19635,"They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.",PENNY,LEONARD
19636,"Stop that, this isn’t India.",HOWARD,HOWARD
19637,And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19638,"You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19639,I see. Take me to Leonard.,SHELDON,PENNY
19640,"Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19641,"Oh my God, I love this chicken.",PENNY,SHELDON
19642,Forget science. She’s horny.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19643,"Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.",OTHERS,HOWARD
19644,Okay.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19645,"I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.",SHELDON,PENNY
19646,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
19647,"Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.",PENNY,LEONARD
19648,A good wife would go to the store.,SHELDON,SHELDON
19649,Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.,HOWARD,HOWARD
19650,Oh. Who knows?,SHELDON,PENNY
19651,Of course.,OTHERS,PENNY
19652,"Hi, guys.",PENNY,LEONARD
19653,"Alright, back to the game.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19654,"Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19655,All right. It is a comfortable chair.,SHELDON,HOWARD
19656,How about that!,RAJ,SHELDON
19657,Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.,RAJ,SHELDON
19658,I guess I should go.,OTHERS,LEONARD
19659,Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?,SHELDON,RAJ
19660,Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19661,She lied.,LEONARD,SHELDON
19662,Where? To Babies R Us?,OTHERS,SHELDON
19663,"That’s very thoughtful, but I think I’ll finish my coffee first.",OTHERS,SHELDON
19664,"So, what are we gonna do first?",OTHERS,SHELDON
19665,‘Sup?,SHELDON,PENNY
19666,"Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.",LEONARD,LEONARD
19667,"No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.",HOWARD,PENNY
19668,Yes.,LEONARD,RAJ
19669,What?,OTHERS,RAJ
19670,Very well.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19671,"No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19672,So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.,PENNY,SHELDON
19673,"I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.",RAJ,SHELDON
19674,"What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?",HOWARD,SHELDON
19675,I know.,SHELDON,RAJ
19676,"No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.",SHELDON,HOWARD
19677,I was missing you again.,OTHERS,RAJ
19678,"Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…",PENNY,PENNY
19679,"Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19680,There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.,RAJ,LEONARD
19681,"You mean the box, right?",SHELDON,SHELDON
19682,Why does this bother you so much?,OTHERS,LEONARD
19683,"Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint.",HOWARD,LEONARD
19684,I’m ba-ack!,SHELDON,PENNY
19685,Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.,HOWARD,SHELDON
19686,Okay.,PENNY,LEONARD
19687,"All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.",PENNY,LEONARD
19688,You know why.,PENNY,PENNY
19689,Can’t talk. In the zone.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19690,"Dude, my parents just split up.",RAJ,LEONARD
19691,"That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
19692,"Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.",PENNY,LEONARD
19693,Why?,HOWARD,PENNY
19694,Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.,RAJ,SHELDON
19695,"Uh, please tell me what to say next.",OTHERS,PENNY
19696,"So, how was your date?",SHELDON,PENNY
19697,"Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.",SHELDON,LEONARD
19698,I think it shrunk! I’m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!,OTHERS,LEONARD
19699,"Oh, no.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19700,"So, she’s not too much for you?",OTHERS,HOWARD
19701,Yes.,PENNY,PENNY
19702,And you’re stuck?,PENNY,LEONARD
19703,"It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.",SHELDON,SHELDON
19704,What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?,RAJ,SHELDON
19705,Why would he call me?,LEONARD,PENNY
19706,Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
19707,"You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.",SHELDON,OTHERS

19781,She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.,LEONARD,SHELDON
19782,"I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?",SHELDON,LEONARD
19783,"Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?",SHELDON,SHELDON

19795,"I thought it’d be a little more, just more.",LEONARD,PENNY
19796,"Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.",SHELDON,LEONARD

19848,And?,OTHERS,SHELDON
19849,"String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?",SHELDON,SHELDON

19890,"The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts.

19895,It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
19896,"Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.",HOWARD,SHELDON

20064,"No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.",OTHERS,HOWARD
20065,Why are you carrying extras?,LEONARD,LEONARD
20066,There’s more than one?,OTHERS,HOWARD

20070,What are we doing?,LEONARD,PENNY
20071,"Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?",RAJ,OTHERS

20241,We’re pinned down.,LEONARD,RAJ
20242,Do it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
20243,I was found guilty and fined $533.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20244,"Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20245,"Well, that’s got to be a good feeling.",OTHERS,LEONARD
20246,You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.,SHELDON,LEONARD
20247,What? You’re kidding!,LEONARD,OTHERS
20248,Let’s think.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20249,Maybe Friday.,PENNY,SHELDON
20250,"Oh, Sheldon.",OTHERS,SHELDON
20251,"Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.",RAJ,HOWARD
20252,"Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s",SHELDON,SHELDON
20253,And your father? Alive?,SHELDON,PENNY
20254,"I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve done wrong.  Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…",HOWARD,PENNY
20255,"So that means I lose, right? It’s over?",PENNY,SHELDON
20256,"I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?",SHELDON,LEONARD
20257,"Well, it just wasn’t the right time.",PENNY,LEONARD
20258,"Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?",OTHERS,LEONARD
20259,"Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?",HOWARD,SHELDON
20260,"Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.",SHELDON,HOWARD
20261,"Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.",RAJ,PENNY
20262,You did flop around a lot.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20263,"And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20264,"Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.",SHELDON,PENNY
20265,You’re pregnant?,LEONARD,LEONARD
20266,That ain’t Sheldon.,HOWARD,SHELDON
20267,I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20268,What?,LEONARD,PENNY
20269,What? He’s loving it?,PENNY,SHELDON
20270,"Oh, yeah? What about it?",LEONARD,RAJ
20271,"Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20272,"Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.",OTHERS,SHELDON
20273,"Oh, and the fairy tale continues.",PENNY,PENNY
20274,Whee-ee-ee!,OTHERS,SHELDON
20275,What are you working on?,LEONARD,PENNY
20276,With Dungeons and Dragons dice?,HOWARD,SHELDON
20277,"Okay, good night.",LEONARD,PENNY
20278,"Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.",SHELDON,RAJ
20279,How the hell did a pigeon get in here?,HOWARD,LEONARD
20280,I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.,LEONARD,OTHERS
20281,"Well, where’s that information been this whole time?",LEONARD,PENNY
20282,Why wouldn’t you tell Leonard?,OTHERS,LEONARD
20283,Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.,LEONARD,RAJ
20284,"Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20285,"You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20286,"Ooh, I call Kermit.",RAJ,RAJ
20287,There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?,HOWARD,LEONARD
20288,"No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20289,"Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.",PENNY,OTHERS
20290,Nobody cares. Do you know how long it’s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?,RAJ,RAJ
20291,That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.,OTHERS,PENNY
20292,Also mine.,HOWARD,SHELDON
20293,No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.,RAJ,PENNY
20294,"Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.",RAJ,PENNY
20295,I just meant a question about the drug.,PENNY,HOWARD
20296,"All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?",HOWARD,LEONARD
20297,Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…,SHELDON,HOWARD
20298,"I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20299,What are you going to tell your mother?,RAJ,HOWARD
20300,Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20301,"Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?",LEONARD,SHELDON
20302,A Slim Jim?,LEONARD,LEONARD
20303,It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.,SHELDON,RAJ
20304,"Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20305,"I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.",SHELDON,PENNY
20306,This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.,SHELDON,OTHERS
20307,"Gee, you think?",PENNY,LEONARD
20308,Can we please change the subject?,LEONARD,RAJ
20309,"Oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.",RAJ,OTHERS
20310,I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.,SHELDON,LEONARD
20311,What did she say when you told her?,OTHERS,LEONARD
20312,Hey.,HOWARD,PENNY
20313,I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.,OTHERS,PENNY
20314,"Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20315,"Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.",PENNY,SHELDON
20316,Well what do you want to write?,RAJ,SHELDON
20317,He’s right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20318,"There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.",HOWARD,OTHERS
20319,"And I’m gonna miss you, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
20320,"Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?",SHELDON,SHELDON
20321,"What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.",RAJ,HOWARD
20322,"I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you.",PENNY,OTHERS
20323,Why not?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20324,"Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.",PENNY,RAJ
20325,You seen Sheldon?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20326,What about me and Howard?,OTHERS,LEONARD
20327,"Um, well, I, yeah, you got me.",PENNY,LEONARD
20328,"Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.",PENNY,SHELDON
20329,That’s a risk I’m willing to take.,SHELDON,PENNY
20330,"I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?",SHELDON,SHELDON
20331,Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.,PENNY,HOWARD
20332,"My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20333,"I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.",LEONARD,HOWARD
20334,"Well, now I miss him even more.",PENNY,LEONARD
20335,How long has he been stuck?,HOWARD,SHELDON
20336,Thank you.,SHELDON,PENNY
20337,"Kreplach, A hearty Klingon… dumpling.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20338,"Well, have you talked to them about it?",OTHERS,SHELDON
20339,"It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20340,"Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.",OTHERS,HOWARD
20341,No way. Not Bill Murray.,RAJ,SHELDON
20342,So where are we going?,OTHERS,SHELDON
20343,"We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20344,"Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20345,"To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20346,"Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.",PENNY,SHELDON
20347,"Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.",OTHERS,LEONARD
20348,Why would you open mine?,LEONARD,PENNY
20349,"Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20350,"Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand.",PENNY,SHELDON
20351,That was three weeks ago.,LEONARD,HOWARD
20352,That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.,SHELDON,LEONARD
20353,Anythingforagreencard.com?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20354,Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20355,"No. Look, this has to stop.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20356,Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?,OTHERS,SHELDON
20357,Great.,PENNY,HOWARD
20358,"Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.",PENNY,OTHERS
20359,"Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?",LEONARD,PENNY
20360,"It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20361,I think I left my pen in there.,SHELDON,PENNY
20362,"Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20363,What are you worried about?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20364,Yes.,OTHERS,SHELDON

20366,"What, Whatever.",OTHERS,PENNY
20367,Howie.,OTHERS,PENNY
20368,"Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?",LEONARD,HOWARD
20369,"If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.",SHELDON,HOWARD
20370,Sheldon.,LEONARD,PENNY
20371,"Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.",OTHERS,LEONARD
20372,"We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.",OTHERS,PENNY
20373,"Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.",PENNY,SHELDON
20374,"Howard, have you ever considered us living together?",OTHERS,SHELDON
20375,"Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?",PENNY,PENNY
20376,So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?,HOWARD,LEONARD

20380,Thanks.,OTHERS,LEONARD
20381,I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?,LEONARD,SHELDON

20383,"Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking.",OTHERS,OTHERS
20384,No.,RAJ,SHELDON

20395,"Well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print.",PENNY,SHELDON
20396,"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20397,"Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20398,"It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.",HOWARD,OTHERS
20399,I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.,HOWARD,PENNY
20400,Do you think I’m feminine?,RAJ,HOWARD
20401,That is reasonable. But what room?,HOWARD,SHELDON
20402,I thought you were leaving the apartment.,SHELDON,RAJ
20403,"Leonard, are you okay here?",OTHERS,SHELDON
20404,You know Klingon.,PENNY,OTHERS
20405,But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.,SHELDON,OTHERS
20406,That’s preposterous.,SHELDON,LEONARD
20407,"No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20408,Couple of weirdos. Why?,LEONARD,SHELDON

20427,"Well, you shouldn’t.",LEONARD,HOWARD
20428,maybe we should take a little break.,LEONARD,SHELDON

20444,Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.,SHELDON,RAJ
20445,Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.,RAJ,SHELDON

20506,Give it a second.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20507,"For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!",SHELDON,HOWARD
20508,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY
20509,"Uh, my plans with Priya.",RAJ,PENNY
20510,The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.,SHELDON,PENNY

20534,No. It’s just…,HOWARD,PENNY
20535,"Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.",SHELDON,LEONARD

20551,What about if you went out with me?,LEONARD,LEONARD
20552,"Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me.",SHELDON,RAJ
20553,"So, you really gonna break up with her?",PENNY,OTHERS

20563,"Okay, he’s going to jail.",HOWARD,HOWARD
20564,"I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20565,"Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?",SHELDON,PENNY

20576,"What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
20577,It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.,SHELDON,PENNY
20578,Thanks.,OTHERS,SHELDON

20657,But you won’t be living here.,LEONARD,SHELDON

20781,What do you think?,OTHERS,HOWARD
20782,"This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.",SHELDON,RAJ
20783,"There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?",LEONARD,SHELDON
20784,"Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?",LEONARD,SHELDON
20785,"Well, don’t do it on the phone.",HOWARD,SHELDON
20786,"Me, too, I missed you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20787,Probably not.,PENNY,SHELDON
20788,It really bothers him?,PENNY,PENNY
20789,"Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20790,I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20791,"I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20792,And I’m gonna eat it all.,HOWARD,PENNY
20793,Schnapps.,PENNY,SHELDON

20796,How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.,RAJ,PENNY
20797,There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.,LEONARD,HOWARD
20798,"Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I’m sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?",PENNY,SHELDON
20799,"Ooh, Real Sex.",HOWARD,OTHERS

20802,"Wait, I have my iPad.",OTHERS,SHELDON
20803,"Hey, could you please go to the market for me?",OTHERS,SHELDON
20804,"So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?",LEONARD,SHELDON
20805,It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.,SHELDON,PENNY

20812,I invited you to my murder mystery party.,RAJ,LEONARD
20813,Think harder.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20814,"Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?",PENNY,SHELDON
20815,Leonard?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20816,"There. It’s late. Now, go to bed. I’m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.",OTHERS,SHELDON
20817,I guess we’d better go after him.,HOWARD,SHELDON
20818,"Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.",SHELDON,PENNY
20819,"This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20820,Absolutely.,PENNY,HOWARD
20821,"You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.",LEONARD,PENNY
20822,"So it’s settled, we’re not doing it.",SHELDON,PENNY
20823,You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.,OTHERS,PENNY
20824,"Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.",PENNY,SHELDON
20825,Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?,SHELDON,SHELDON

20834,"When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20835,I’m the dumplings.,PENNY,LEONARD
20836,"Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.",SHELDON,PENNY
20837,I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20838,Good buddy Leonard.  Good buddy Leonard.  Good buddy Leonard.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20839,"Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?",LEONARD,SHELDON
20840,They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
20841,"Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone.",SHELDON,OTHERS
20842,Great.,LEONARD,LEONARD
20843,Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?,SHELDON,SHELDON
20844,"Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.",PENNY,HOWARD
20845,"It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.",HOWARD,SHELDON
20846,"Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?",PENNY,PENNY
20847,Uh-huh.,HOWARD,LEONARD

20850,"What, what did I do?",OTHERS,LEONARD
20851,Ha-a-a. Still funny.,RAJ,HOWARD
20852,Hi. Again.,LEONARD,PENNY
20853,Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.,OTHERS,PENNY
20854,"If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20855,Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?,SHELDON,SHELDON
20856,Yes.,SHELDON,OTHERS
20857,Talk about your chick magnets.,HOWARD,SHELDON
20858,"Well, thanks for the tip.",OTHERS,PENNY
20859,"Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.",OTHERS,PENNY

20862,"Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo.",PENNY,OTHERS
20863,"Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.",RAJ,LEONARD
20864,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.,SHELDON,PENNY
20865,Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20866,It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.,LEONARD,LEONARD
20867,Not a lot.,HOWARD,LEONARD
20868,"Oh, my. It’s not a contest.",PENNY,PENNY
20869,"Shake it, baby.",PENNY,SHELDON
20870,Here we go.,OTHERS,LEONARD

20874,"Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.",PENNY,LEONARD
20875,I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.,SHELDON,RAJ
20876,It looks like I’m going into space after all.,HOWARD,LEONARD
20877,"A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.",SHELDON,HOWARD

20884,"Wow, that’s brilliant.",LEONARD,HOWARD
20885,As you?,PENNY,SHELDON
20886,"Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!",SHELDON,PENNY
20887,"Hello, Father. We need to talk.",RAJ,PENNY
20888,"She’s gone, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20889,"Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?",HOWARD,SHELDON
20890,Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.,OTHERS,LEONARD
20891,"Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.",SHELDON,HOWARD
20892,"It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?",OTHERS,LEONARD
20893,"Well, I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.",RAJ,HOWARD
20894,We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20895,"No, there’s not.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20896,"Well that’s not much of an apology, but I’ll take it.",SHELDON,OTHERS
20897,I’d like you to call me sexy.,RAJ,PENNY
20898,Let’s go.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20899,"You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you.",PENNY,LEONARD
20900,Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20901,"Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20902,"Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.",HOWARD,PENNY
20903,Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?,PENNY,LEONARD
20904,"Oh, cool. Are there pictures?",PENNY,SHELDON
20905,"That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.",SHELDON,PENNY
20906,So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.,LEONARD,LEONARD
20907,"Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20908,"Becauth  Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.",HOWARD,SHELDON
20909,"Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20910,How much?,OTHERS,OTHERS
20911,"And that didn’t work out, did it?",SHELDON,LEONARD
20912,So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?,HOWARD,HOWARD
20913,"Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?",SHELDON,HOWARD
20914,"Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20915,I’m sorry?,RAJ,RAJ
20916,"Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all my clothes.",PENNY,SHELDON
20917,"Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?",LEONARD,HOWARD
20918,"I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.",RAJ,SHELDON
20919,Alright.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20920,I don’t want to go anywhere.,HOWARD,RAJ
20921,"Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.",PENNY,LEONARD
20922,"Yes, exactly.",SHELDON,OTHERS
20923,Relax. We’re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20924,Sheldon?,HOWARD,RAJ
20925,We’ve had this planned for a week.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20926,No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.,RAJ,PENNY
20927,You know what would be nice?,SHELDON,SHELDON
20928,And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.,SHELDON,PENNY
20929,"Unlikely. That’s a television show, Leonard.",SHELDON,HOWARD
20930,You’re unbelievable.,PENNY,LEONARD
20931,That doesn’t count. Do over! Do over!,HOWARD,SHELDON
20932,Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.,HOWARD,LEONARD
20933,"Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20934,By the end. Yeah.,PENNY,RAJ
20935,"Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.",LEONARD,HOWARD
20936,That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.,HOWARD,SHELDON
20937,You don’t need your dad’s money. You can get by on your salary.,HOWARD,PENNY
20938,Hardly.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20939,"Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20940,"So, we’ll just order three entrees.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20941,"No, but I did go to the International Space Station.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20942,"Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20943,I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
20944,"Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>",SHELDON,SHELDON
20945,She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.,PENNY,SHELDON
20946,What are you doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
20947,August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20948,One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.,SHELDON,SHELDON
20949,I can’t believe I miss Stuart.,HOWARD,LEONARD
20950,"Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.",HOWARD,HOWARD
20951,"Oh, pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.",RAJ,SHELDON
20952,Homo Novus doesn’t know.,SHELDON,LEONARD
20953,I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.,LEONARD,LEONARD
20954,"Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.",OTHERS,SHELDON
20955,That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?,OTHERS,SHELDON
20956,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20957,"I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.",HOWARD,OTHERS
20958,"Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.",PENNY,SHELDON
20959,"Uh, 12 bucks.",LEONARD,SHELDON
20960,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
20961,"Well, I do.",PENNY,SHELDON
20962,"Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20963,So Penny’s a little messy.,LEONARD,PENNY
20964,Hi.,SHELDON,LEONARD

20967,Are you okay?,LEONARD,LEONARD
20968,Good night.,LEONARD,RAJ
20969,Good. Love you.,HOWARD,OTHERS
20970,"Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again.",SHELDON,LEONARD
20971,But how were our seats?,SHELDON,SHELDON
20972,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
20973,"Thanks, Dad.",LEONARD,LEONARD
20974,"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…",SHELDON,HOWARD
20975,Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?,PENNY,PENNY
20976,"Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?",PENNY,SHELDON

20978,It actually was kind of fun.,OTHERS,SHELDON
20979,"Oh, so is mine.",HOWARD,SHELDON
20980,He’s right.,RAJ,LEONARD
20981,What’s wrong?,SHELDON,LEONARD
20982,I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.,SHELDON,PENNY
20983,"Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.",SHELDON,PENNY
20984,I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.,PENNY,SHELDON
20985,That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?,LEONARD,PENNY
20986,"Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20987,"Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.",RAJ,PENNY
20988,Because he’s hitting on you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
20989,"Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
20990,Penny’s up.,LEONARD,LEONARD

20993,Not.,PENNY,HOWARD
20994,He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.,SHELDON,LEONARD

20996,"Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.",HOWARD,LEONARD
20997,Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.,OTHERS,LEONARD
20998,"Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?",LEONARD,HOWARD
20999,We should hang up.,HOWARD,SHELDON
21000,Now?,SHELDON,LEONARD
21001,And he should know a lot of women.,HOWARD,LEONARD
21002,"Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?",HOWARD,PENNY
21003,I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?,PENNY,SHELDON
21004,Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21005,"Oh, no.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21006,What window?,PENNY,SHELDON
21007,"As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21008,"If the judge couldn’t explain it to me, I don’t see how you will.",SHELDON,LEONARD

21021,"Okay, he can have carrot cake.",PENNY,LEONARD
21022,"What, who told you that?",LEONARD,LEONARD
21023,Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.,OTHERS,SHELDON
21024,You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?,OTHERS,SHELDON
21025,Hi.,HOWARD,SHELDON
21026,"You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.",OTHERS,SHELDON

21030,"Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21031,She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.,PENNY,HOWARD

21035,"This is very nice Stuart, thank you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21036,"Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21037,Want some Chinese food?,LEONARD,SHELDON
21038,Mmm.,OTHERS,PENNY
21039,Where did you get a ring?,PENNY,SHELDON
21040,"H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.",RAJ,SHELDON

21042,You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.,OTHERS,LEONARD
21043,Sorry. Did I startle you?,OTHERS,SHELDON
21044,"But you got it, right?",SHELDON,OTHERS
21045,"It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.",SHELDON,RAJ
21046,Can’t.,PENNY,PENNY
21047,"The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21048,"The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I’m supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it’s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You’ve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?",OTHERS,SHELDON

21050,Great. Now Mandarin.,SHELDON,PENNY
21051,"I, I think he wants us to pull over.",RAJ,RAJ
21052,That’s a risk I’m willing to take.,OTHERS,PENNY
21053,Bernie would love that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
21054,"Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?",RAJ,RAJ
21055,"How about it, Sheldon?",LEONARD,LEONARD
21056,Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?,SHELDON,PENNY
21057,I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?,OTHERS,SHELDON
21058,How does it different from the money I have?,SHELDON,RAJ
21059,"Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.",LEONARD,PENNY
21060,You okay?,LEONARD,PENNY
21061,You’re defacing my work.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21062,"You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21063,"Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.",OTHERS,HOWARD
21064,"Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.",SHELDON,PENNY
21065,"You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.",PENNY,SHELDON
21066,"Well, there’s no reason you can’t.",OTHERS,PENNY
21067,Do you like it?,OTHERS,PENNY
21068,"So, Penny, how’s married life?",OTHERS,PENNY
21069,"Okay, every other month.",RAJ,OTHERS
21070,All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21071,"Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out.",SHELDON,PENNY
21072,"What, now, do you have company?",SHELDON,RAJ
21073,Really?,PENNY,OTHERS
21074,Of course.,PENNY,SHELDON
21075,"Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.",OTHERS,LEONARD
21076,"Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.",PENNY,PENNY
21077,Don’t have one.,PENNY,LEONARD
21078,"Huh, well that’s handy. Um, here’s a question, why?",PENNY,LEONARD
21079,It knows.,SHELDON,RAJ
21080,"I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.",RAJ,LEONARD
21081,"No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21082,"Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who’s next?",PENNY,SHELDON
21083,"Good thinking.  Cinnamon, come to Daddy.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21084,You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21085,Yes!,PENNY,HOWARD
21086,Was I hit on the head by a coconut.,SHELDON,PENNY
21087,"That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21088,And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?,SHELDON,PENNY
21089,"Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke’s only funny in Nebraska.",PENNY,SHELDON
21090,The Conqueror.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21091,"Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.",PENNY,SHELDON
21092,"Okay, sweetie, I’ll take care of you, what do you need?",PENNY,LEONARD
21093,"Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.",PENNY,LEONARD
21094,Nope.,OTHERS,PENNY
21095,Ready for bed?,HOWARD,RAJ
21096,How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?,LEONARD,SHELDON
21097,"Huh. Okay, I’ll try it.",HOWARD,HOWARD
21098,"Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?",RAJ,HOWARD
21099,Great.,LEONARD,LEONARD
21100,Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.,SHELDON,OTHERS
21101,"Hello, Kripke.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21102,Are you going to let me talk?,PENNY,LEONARD
21103,"Look, it’s got to be around here somewhere.",PENNY,LEONARD
21104,"This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21105,I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?,PENNY,SHELDON
21106,"Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21107,"I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?",SHELDON,SHELDON
21108,"Uh-uh, give it a minute.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21109,"Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21110,"My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,",OTHERS,SHELDON
21111,Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.,RAJ,LEONARD
21112,Perhaps. Are you scared?,HOWARD,PENNY
21113,"That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.",PENNY,SHELDON
21114,Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?,OTHERS,PENNY
21115,What’s that? Some weird sex thing?,HOWARD,OTHERS
21116,"I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.",PENNY,SHELDON
21117,"Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21118,"Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?",PENNY,PENNY
21119,But what are you doing in there?,HOWARD,LEONARD
21120,"Okay, that is it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21121,"Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21122,"Yeah, good for you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21123,I suppose that’s acceptable.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21124,"Well, what are you gonna do?",LEONARD,SHELDON
21125,"Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21126,"Yeah, I don’t think the water was really boiling.",PENNY,HOWARD
21127,"That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.",PENNY,LEONARD
21128,I am the bride.,OTHERS,SHELDON
21129,"Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.",SHELDON,RAJ
21130,"Ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.",OTHERS,RAJ
21131,I’m sure I’m overreacting.,LEONARD,LEONARD
21132,"What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?",LEONARD,SHELDON
21133,"I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21134,"Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.",LEONARD,OTHERS
21135,"It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21136,"No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?",HOWARD,LEONARD
21137,I can’t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.,OTHERS,HOWARD
21138,You’re really going to do this?,RAJ,SHELDON
21139,"You’re right, it is simple.",LEONARD,SHELDON
21140,"Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?",SHELDON,LEONARD
21141,"Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them.",LEONARD,SHELDON
21142,"Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?",PENNY,LEONARD
21143,"Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21144,"If you’re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.",HOWARD,SHELDON
21145,Are you okay?,PENNY,LEONARD
21146,What is wrong with you?,RAJ,SHELDON
21147,I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.,SHELDON,RAJ
21148,Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.,PENNY,PENNY
21149,"Yeah, me, too. Love you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21150,"Of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.",SHELDON,HOWARD
21151,Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.,PENNY,SHELDON
21152,What a nice girl.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21153,"Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?",LEONARD,RAJ
21154,"Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21155,Yeah?,LEONARD,LEONARD
21156,"Uh, Sheldon…",RAJ,LEONARD
21157,"Oh, that’s cool.",PENNY,PENNY
21158,"Oh, that’s so beautiful.",PENNY,RAJ
21159,The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
21160,"Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride.",RAJ,SHELDON
21161,Hey.,LEONARD,HOWARD
21162,"Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.",LEONARD,SHELDON
21163,"According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night.",OTHERS,LEONARD
21164,"Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.",RAJ,SHELDON
21165,Oh. Okay. Thank you.,OTHERS,PENNY
21166,"Wait, where are you going?",LEONARD,PENNY
21167,You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.,HOWARD,LEONARD
21168,Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.,LEONARD,RAJ
21169,I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.,SHELDON,HOWARD
21170,"Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.",HOWARD,PENNY
21171,"Yes, I remember.",LEONARD,PENNY
21172,"Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.",PENNY,SHELDON
21173,Her name’s Rebecca.,OTHERS,RAJ
21174,Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21175,"Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21176,"Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies.",SHELDON,PENNY
21177,"I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.",PENNY,HOWARD
21178,Sick?,SHELDON,LEONARD
21179,"No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.",HOWARD,RAJ
21180,I think this thing was made in China.,RAJ,LEONARD
21181,"I’m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems.",RAJ,SHELDON
21182,"I love the way you say, I’d love that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21183,"Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.",OTHERS,OTHERS
21184,"How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21185,"Oh, you’re not. You look awful.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21186,Hold my line.,HOWARD,LEONARD
21187,"I’ve been out here three months, and all I’ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21188,All right.,PENNY,LEONARD
21189,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
21190,Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?,SHELDON,OTHERS
21191,You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.,LEONARD,OTHERS
21192,"I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?",OTHERS,LEONARD
21193,"I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.",SHELDON,RAJ
21194,"Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.",LEONARD,PENNY
21195,"Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…",LEONARD,SHELDON
21196,"Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21197,Good what?,SHELDON,LEONARD
21198,No.,SHELDON,HOWARD
21199,"Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?",SHELDON,PENNY
21200,"Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?",OTHERS,LEONARD
21201,I really don’t want to talk about it.,PENNY,PENNY
21202,I like the Wii.,OTHERS,LEONARD
21203,I can see.,PENNY,SHELDON
21204,You can’t be serious.,HOWARD,HOWARD
21205,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?,RAJ,PENNY
21206,Come in.,PENNY,LEONARD
21207,"Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way.",RAJ,SHELDON
21208,It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21209,What’s going on?,LEONARD,HOWARD
21210,It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.,SHELDON,PENNY
21211,"Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?",OTHERS,SHELDON
21212,"It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21213,"All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.",HOWARD,SHELDON
21214,What’s the protocol for leaving?,SHELDON,SHELDON
21215,"Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21216,"Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready.",PENNY,SHELDON
21217,Amy.,PENNY,PENNY
21218,"So, what are you guys doing?",PENNY,HOWARD
21219,"Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21220,"Oh, okay. Sounds like it’s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?",RAJ,LEONARD
21221,Oh.,PENNY,OTHERS
21222,"Hi, guys.",OTHERS,SHELDON
21223,No!,PENNY,SHELDON
21224,Knock yourself out.,RAJ,LEONARD
21225,I think she means not a weirdo.,PENNY,LEONARD
21226,Penny says they’re ready to go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
21227,Considering what? How great this place looks?,SHELDON,HOWARD
21228,Excuse me?,LEONARD,OTHERS
21229,"Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21230,"Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.",LEONARD,SHELDON
21231,"Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21232,I think we should talk now.,PENNY,LEONARD
21233,We’re glad you could make it.,RAJ,LEONARD
21234,He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21235,"All right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something.",HOWARD,SHELDON
21236,"Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21237,"You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?",OTHERS,LEONARD
21238,No!,LEONARD,HOWARD
21239,"Nice. I’m meeting someone, too.",OTHERS,PENNY
21240,"Well, it’s Thai food night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
21241,You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21242,"Daddy, he had nothing to do…",PENNY,SHELDON
21243,Yeah. You’re a hottie.,OTHERS,LEONARD
21244,"Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.",PENNY,SHELDON
21245,I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21246,"No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.",PENNY,SHELDON
21247,Ruin it for me and I’ll break this glass over your head.,OTHERS,LEONARD
21248,"I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.",PENNY,SHELDON
21249,"Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21250,"Yeah, but if he’s a sore loser, maybe you’re better off without him.",RAJ,SHELDON
21251,That sounds like fun.,PENNY,SHELDON
21252,"All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.",SHELDON,PENNY
21253,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
21254,There’s gonna be a test?,PENNY,PENNY
21255,"Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.",PENNY,SHELDON
21256,"My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?",SHELDON,SHELDON
21257,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
21258,"Yes, obviously.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21259,"So, what are we gonna do?",OTHERS,LEONARD
21260,"Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.",HOWARD,LEONARD
21261,Soap spots. Wash ’em again.,OTHERS,OTHERS
21262,Both of us.,PENNY,LEONARD
21263,"Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?",SHELDON,SHELDON
21264,Please don’t say it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
21265,"A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.",RAJ,LEONARD
21266,Just like your mommy used to make.,OTHERS,SHELDON
21267,"Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.",SHELDON,HOWARD
21268,"Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself.",RAJ,SHELDON
21269,Wow. I’ve never thought about that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
21270,You just got him this afternoon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
21271,So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?,OTHERS,SHELDON
21272,"Listen, we need to talk.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21273,"You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21274,"No, I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!",PENNY,RAJ
21275,"Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.",SHELDON,PENNY
21276,"Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?",OTHERS,LEONARD
21277,I think you’re just making that up.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21278,"Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21279,I know everything about this stuff.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21280,"Hey, can I ask you a question?",PENNY,HOWARD
21281,"Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?",SHELDON,PENNY
21282,I just got a part on a TV show.,PENNY,SHELDON
21283,"Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.",RAJ,LEONARD
21284,"All right, we’ll wait.",OTHERS,LEONARD
21285,"How could you have gotten it from me, I’m not sick.",PENNY,SHELDON
21286,Not recently.,PENNY,LEONARD
21287,"Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.",RAJ,SHELDON
21288,"Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21289,"Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21290,I’ll pull the van up.,RAJ,PENNY
21291,"Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.",HOWARD,SHELDON
21292,Don’t ask.,HOWARD,SHELDON
21293,It’s Penny’s.,OTHERS,SHELDON
21294,No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?,RAJ,PENNY
21295,I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.,OTHERS,SHELDON
21296,Did you really have to bring it in with you?,RAJ,SHELDON
21297,I know. When is she going home?,LEONARD,SHELDON
21298,Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.,OTHERS,OTHERS
21299,"You know  Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!",HOWARD,SHELDON
21300,"Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.",RAJ,PENNY
21301,That’s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.,PENNY,SHELDON
21302,"So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?",RAJ,LEONARD
21303,"Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.",LEONARD,SHELDON
21304,May I take your cloak?,PENNY,SHELDON
21305,"Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.",OTHERS,RAJ
21306,I know it’s kinda weird.,PENNY,SHELDON
21307,"Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?",RAJ,SHELDON
21308,Exactly. Right after they said yeah.,LEONARD,OTHERS
21309,"Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…",PENNY,PENNY
21310,The two aren’t mutually exclusive!,LEONARD,LEONARD
21311,Over what?,RAJ,PENNY
21312,"Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.",PENNY,SHELDON
21313,"Okay, well, if I move in, you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?",RAJ,SHELDON
21314,"Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21315,"Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.",PENNY,LEONARD
21316,I brought you a little gift. New kite.,HOWARD,SHELDON
21317,Leonard and Penny!  Leonard and Penny!  Leonard and Penny!,SHELDON,HOWARD
21318,"Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.",RAJ,HOWARD
21319,"Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.",PENNY,HOWARD
21320,There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…,RAJ,LEONARD

21322,We’re not supposed to talk during this part.,SHELDON,LEONARD
21323,"All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.",HOWARD,SHELDON
21324,What the hell is eighth base?,LEONARD,SHELDON
21325,"Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.",PENNY,SHELDON

21331,I’ll just go look for it.,PENNY,SHELDON
21332,"Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.",PENNY,SHELDON
21333,"I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them.",HOWARD,SHELDON

21335,"I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.",LEONARD,PENNY
21336,"Great, what’s your pl…",RAJ,SHELDON
21337,"No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21338,"Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?",LEONARD,SHELDON
21339,"No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21340,"Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?",RAJ,SHELDON
21341,"Don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.",OTHERS,LEONARD
21342,She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?,SHELDON,SHELDON
21343,I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.,OTHERS,HOWARD
21344,Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?,HOWARD,SHELDON
21345,"Wll, she is. I didn’t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.",OTHERS,LEONARD
21346,I guess I could probably try a little harder.,PENNY,SHELDON

21350,"No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21351,You?,OTHERS,PENNY
21352,How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21353,"You’re right, we can’t.",PENNY,SHELDON
21354,"Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21355,"Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine.",SHELDON,LEONARD
21356,"Hey, I don’t even live here.",RAJ,SHELDON
21357,Let’s say it together.,OTHERS,LEONARD

21360,What the hell was that?,PENNY,SHELDON
21361,"No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline.",SHELDON,SHELDON

21373,And I appreciate the pretence.,SHELDON,SHELDON
21374,"Okay, let’s talk about that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
21375,"Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you.",SHELDON,PENNY
21376,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.,RAJ,OTHERS
21377,"Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?",LEONARD,SHELDON
21378,"All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.",PENNY,OTHERS
21379,What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?,PENNY,RAJ

21386,It’s okay.,PENNY,PENNY
21387,"Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.",SHELDON,SHELDON
21388,Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?,OTHERS,PENNY
21389,What do you want?,PENNY,PENNY

21391,I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.,SHELDON,PENNY
21392,I know. You’re safe.,PENNY,LEONARD
21393,"I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?",SHELDON,HOWARD

21399,I stopped counting at four.,LEONARD,SHELDON

21402,What are you guys doing here?,OTHERS,PENNY
21403,We do?,PENNY,SHELDON
21404,I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.,LEONARD,SHELDON
21405,Nobody can.,RAJ,OTHERS
21406,Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?,SHELDON,HOWARD

21415,You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?,OTHERS,SHELDON
21416,He’s been crying?,PENNY,PENNY
21417,"Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.",SHELDON,HOWARD
21418,You all right?,LEONARD,HOWARD
21419,I went into this marriage with so much hope.,PENNY,SHELDON
21420,"Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.",RAJ,SHELDON

21499,That’s really stupid advice.,HOWARD,HOWARD
21500,"Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.",OTHERS,OTHERS

22130,"Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22131,"Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22132,Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.,PENNY,HOWARD
22133,Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.,PENNY,LEONARD
22134,Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!,SHELDON,LEONARD
22135,You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.,SHELDON,OTHERS
22136,No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.,PENNY,LEONARD
22137,Take us to a place we can waltz.,PENNY,LEONARD
22138,"Yup, we’re all in.",PENNY,LEONARD
22139,"Hey, I want to try.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22140,"Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22141,"Yeah, she’s kind of a Wheel savant.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22142,It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22143,"Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay.",PENNY,PENNY
22144,You could power down.,RAJ,SHELDON
22145,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22146,"Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22147,"Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.",RAJ,SHELDON
22148,"Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22149,I’m going back to bed.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22150,I’m leaving.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22151,"So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.",HOWARD,RAJ
22152,"All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22153,Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.,RAJ,SHELDON
22154,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22155,I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.,PENNY,SHELDON
22156,"Come on, Sheldon, let’s go.",OTHERS,HOWARD
22157,"Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22158,What the hell are you doing?,LEONARD,HOWARD
22159,And he started to slowly wear me down.,PENNY,LEONARD
22160,"Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22161,I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22162,"Well, that didn’t go your way.",RAJ,LEONARD
22163,"What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?",HOWARD,LEONARD
22164,I like it. I think you’re on to something.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22165,Fine. What do you want?,PENNY,PENNY
22166,Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.,OTHERS,HOWARD
22167,"Okay, well, I should unpack.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22168,And may I point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22169,I’ll just roll for you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22170,"Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why don’t you just tell him?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22171,"I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22172,You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?,PENNY,SHELDON
22173,"So, what’s your news, Bernadette?",LEONARD,LEONARD
22174,"Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22175,"Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22176,"Again, no…",LEONARD,RAJ
22177,What is it?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22178,"Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM!  Howard Wolowitz.",HOWARD,PENNY
22179,I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?,OTHERS,PENNY
22180,"Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22181,That’s not ridiculous. Good night.,LEONARD,PENNY
22182,"Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.",PENNY,OTHERS
22183,"My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.",LEONARD,OTHERS
22184,"We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.",OTHERS,PENNY
22185,I didn’t get it.,PENNY,SHELDON
22186,What are you doing?,SHELDON,HOWARD
22187,"Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22188,"Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?",LEONARD,RAJ
22189,Are you okay?!,OTHERS,SHELDON
22190,"Come on, Sheldon, you should go.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22191,"Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.",LEONARD,HOWARD
22192,If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.,RAJ,PENNY
22193,No.,PENNY,RAJ
22194,It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.,RAJ,PENNY
22195,Five.,HOWARD,PENNY
22196,"No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.",PENNY,OTHERS
22197,"Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.  Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.",SHELDON,RAJ
22198,"You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22199,Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.,OTHERS,OTHERS
22200,"No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22201,It’s a little more bleak than I thought.,RAJ,SHELDON
22202,"It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.",RAJ,SHELDON
22203,"Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.",RAJ,HOWARD
22204,"No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry.",PENNY,RAJ
22205,Wise.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22206,Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22207,You were a colossal ass-hat.,HOWARD,RAJ
22208,I’m gonna go talk to Penny.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22209,"Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time.",PENNY,HOWARD
22210,I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22211,"Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22212,That is good news. Bye.,LEONARD,PENNY
22213,"I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22214,Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.,SHELDON,OTHERS
22215,"Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.",HOWARD,PENNY
22216,"Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22217,Invisibility spell.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22218,Hey. What brings you by?,RAJ,SHELDON
22219,The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?,OTHERS,HOWARD
22220,"So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?",OTHERS,HOWARD
22221,You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22222,"Yeah, right.",PENNY,PENNY
22223,"No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.",LEONARD,OTHERS
22224,"I told you before, bears are terrifying.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22225,Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22226,"Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.",SHELDON,PENNY
22227,Everybody stop it with that.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22228,"Well, him about to find out about her.",HOWARD,PENNY
22229,Tammy Cho.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22230,"Oh, you know what? I’m not going.",LEONARD,PENNY
22231,Hold on. When did Priya get here?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22232,"Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.",PENNY,LEONARD
22233,"Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22234,"I’m sorry. He’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22235,"That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?",HOWARD,SHELDON
22236,"No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.",HOWARD,RAJ
22237,How old is this Jell-O?,RAJ,OTHERS
22238,"So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?",PENNY,SHELDON
22239,He brought you a pretty rock.,RAJ,LEONARD
22240,"Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.",RAJ,LEONARD
22241,"If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.",RAJ,PENNY
22242,You’re so stupid.,HOWARD,SHELDON
22243,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
22244,Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.,OTHERS,PENNY
22245,"We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22246,"Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull.",PENNY,LEONARD
22247,He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22248,"Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.",RAJ,SHELDON
22249,Thank you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22250,"I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!",LEONARD,SHELDON
22251,Prescription or non-prescription strength.,SHELDON,PENNY
22252,"Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22253,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?",OTHERS,PENNY
22254,They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22255,Go ahead.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22256,Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22257,"Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.",LEONARD,PENNY
22258,"Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22259,"Emily, Hey.",RAJ,HOWARD
22260,"Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22261,You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.,HOWARD,HOWARD
22262,"Hey, guys.",PENNY,SHELDON
22263,"I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.",RAJ,OTHERS
22264,"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?",OTHERS,RAJ
22265,"I miss you, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22266,I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.,SHELDON,OTHERS
22267,We’re having the best time.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22268,"No, you didn’t.",LEONARD,PENNY
22269,"I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.",PENNY,SHELDON
22270,"Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22271,"No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?",SHELDON,RAJ
22272,Watch me.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22273,"And don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying.  Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags.",OTHERS,PENNY
22274,"I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.",OTHERS,HOWARD
22275,"Look at you, being all mature.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22276,"Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.",LEONARD,LEONARD

22278,"Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.",LEONARD,PENNY
22279,"Sheldon, it’s Saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry.",PENNY,LEONARD
22280,"Okay, what about your friend Amy?",PENNY,PENNY
22281,Hey. Where are the guys?,RAJ,SHELDON
22282,"Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.",SHELDON,OTHERS
22283,He probably just goes to the bathroom.,RAJ,PENNY
22284,I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.,HOWARD,PENNY
22285,"If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22286,Why does it have to get weird?,LEONARD,SHELDON
22287,"August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?",PENNY,SHELDON
22288,"Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22289,"Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.",SHELDON,PENNY
22290,Zack?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22291,The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22292,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22293,"No, you don’t.",PENNY,SHELDON
22294,Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.,RAJ,SHELDON
22295,You think?,LEONARD,HOWARD
22296,Whatever. You have to do something about it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22297,"No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.",RAJ,HOWARD
22298,"No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.",RAJ,LEONARD
22299,Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he’d had money.,OTHERS,PENNY

22303,Cool?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22304,"Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything.",HOWARD,PENNY
22305,Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.,HOWARD,RAJ
22306,We’re going to Long Beach?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22307,Great. Here you go.,LEONARD,HOWARD
22308,"Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.",OTHERS,RAJ
22309,So what’d you think?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22310,"Whew, chilly.",PENNY,OTHERS
22311,You can do better.,OTHERS,OTHERS
22312,Yep.,PENNY,LEONARD
22313,"Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22314,"All right, well, who’s the best superhero?",OTHERS,LEONARD
22315,"It’s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.",RAJ,HOWARD
22316,"You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.",HOWARD,RAJ
22317,"I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.",SHELDON,PENNY

22325,"You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22326,"You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.",LEONARD,SHELDON

22330,"Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us.",LEONARD,LEONARD

22332,"Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22333,What do you mean?,RAJ,LEONARD
22334,"‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22335,What?,OTHERS,HOWARD
22336,"Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…",SHELDON,SHELDON
22337,Thank you for coming by.  Hello.,SHELDON,PENNY

22356,You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.,LEONARD,RAJ
22357,"Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22358,"Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I’m a little warm, so I’m going to turn it down.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22359,"Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.",SHELDON,SHELDON

22387,"Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22388,It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22389,Sheldon.,PENNY,LEONARD
22390,You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.,LEONARD,RAJ
22391,Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?,OTHERS,LEONARD
22392,Why do you think he asked you out again?,OTHERS,PENNY
22393,We’re just talking ma.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22394,"Yes, it’s very nice, goodnight Raj.",PENNY,SHELDON
22395,"Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.",OTHERS,PENNY
22396,"A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22397,To be played with.,SHELDON,PENNY
22398,This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22399,What are you doing?,OTHERS,SHELDON
22400,"Yeah, you know what else it is?",LEONARD,LEONARD
22401,"Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.",SHELDON,PENNY
22402,"Stuart, we’re here.",HOWARD,PENNY
22403,Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22404,"Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22405,"I dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies.",PENNY,SHELDON
22406,"Really, really sorry.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22407,"Yeah, sounds like a drag.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22408,"Leonard, let me look in the box.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22409,"It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?",PENNY,LEONARD
22410,It’s like talking to a chimp.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22411,I started doing it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22412,"Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That’s funny, ask anyone.",RAJ,LEONARD
22413,"Okay, you’re cut off. Anybody need a refill?",PENNY,LEONARD
22414,"Sorry, they’re both married.",PENNY,LEONARD
22415,"Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22416,"Yes. I’d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard’s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O’s for outstanding, which he is such. W’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. A’s for artistic, his ability…",SHELDON,SHELDON
22417,Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22418,You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?,HOWARD,SHELDON
22419,"Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22420,"Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis.",RAJ,SHELDON
22421,Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?,PENNY,PENNY
22422,"Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22423,"Well, find out.",PENNY,LEONARD
22424,Where you can what?,OTHERS,HOWARD
22425,"No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22426,Totally.,LEONARD,PENNY
22427,You’re a good man.,SHELDON,PENNY
22428,"I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.",RAJ,RAJ
22429,I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.,PENNY,SHELDON
22430,Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22431,You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.,PENNY,PENNY
22432,What time do you and Bernadette head out?,RAJ,PENNY
22433,Right. Sorry.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22434,"Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.",SHELDON,OTHERS
22435,It’s happening.,OTHERS,PENNY
22436,"Oh, what did I do?",RAJ,LEONARD
22437,"Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.",PENNY,PENNY
22438,Okay. Good luck.,LEONARD,PENNY
22439,Doing what?,HOWARD,PENNY
22440,I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22441,"Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.",PENNY,LEONARD
22442,"I know. Powerful stuff, huh?",RAJ,SHELDON
22443,Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22444,No.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22445,Great.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22446,Hold on. How did you get him in the car?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22447,Does it really say that?,PENNY,SHELDON
22448,"A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22449,"That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics.",LEONARD,HOWARD
22450,"Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22451,"Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22452,"Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446",SHELDON,SHELDON
22453,"Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.",LEONARD,PENNY
22454,"Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?",LEONARD,LEONARD
22455,The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22456,"Marty, let me call you back.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22457,It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.,RAJ,SHELDON
22458,"Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22459,"Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22460,"Yeah, thank you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22461,I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22462,"You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22463,Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?,SHELDON,OTHERS
22464,"I’d like a frozen yogurt, please.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22465,"You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22466,That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.,PENNY,PENNY
22467,Thy will be done.,HOWARD,PENNY
22468,Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.,PENNY,LEONARD
22469,We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.,OTHERS,RAJ
22470,I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.,SHELDON,RAJ
22471,A few minutes it is.,PENNY,SHELDON
22472,What happened to your backup?,OTHERS,SHELDON
22473,Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?,LEONARD,PENNY
22474,Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?,HOWARD,SHELDON
22475,You really don’t know why?,PENNY,HOWARD
22476,Why?,PENNY,PENNY
22477,Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.,PENNY,RAJ
22478,Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22479,Yeah.,HOWARD,RAJ
22480,"How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon.",PENNY,LEONARD
22481,All he had was an idea.,SHELDON,PENNY
22482,This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22483,Oh. That’s a big step.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22484,I prefer to think that I can’t lose.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22485,"I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22486,"That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?",SHELDON,LEONARD
22487,"Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22488,"‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.",PENNY,RAJ
22489,Here’s your soup.,PENNY,SHELDON
22490,Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?,RAJ,SHELDON
22491,"Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?",SHELDON,RAJ
22492,Not that old school. He knows.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22493,No.,LEONARD,PENNY
22494,"Don’t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!",SHELDON,SHELDON
22495,"No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22496,Thank you.,PENNY,SHELDON
22497,"Hey, you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22498,"Hello, Leonard. I hope you’re hungry.",OTHERS,PENNY
22499,Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22500,"So, where were we?",HOWARD,LEONARD
22501,"Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.",PENNY,OTHERS
22502,Why?,PENNY,PENNY
22503,I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.,RAJ,OTHERS
22504,"No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.",SHELDON,PENNY
22505,Lesley and I do research together at the University.,LEONARD,RAJ
22506,I don’t freaking believe this.,RAJ,PENNY
22507,That would probably save us some time.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22508,"And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22509,"Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.",LEONARD,OTHERS
22510,"Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22511,"Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22512,"Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.",SHELDON,HOWARD
22513,"Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22514,"Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22515,By stalking them?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22516,"Oh, okay, I get it now.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22517,"Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.",PENNY,OTHERS
22518,Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22519,"Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22520,Okay.,OTHERS,PENNY
22521,"Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22522,That narrows it down.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22523,"Oh, crap!",LEONARD,PENNY
22524,You understood the math?,LEONARD,SHELDON
22525,The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22526,"Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry.",OTHERS,PENNY
22527,"Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.",SHELDON,OTHERS
22528,"How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?",PENNY,SHELDON
22529,It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22530,"Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22531,Yeah.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22532,"Forgiven, forgiven.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22533,I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22534,"Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle.",SHELDON,PENNY
22535,"Yeah, hi.",PENNY,SHELDON
22536,"Relax, it wasn’t your fault.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22537,All right.,PENNY,LEONARD
22538,Did you have fun doing it?,SHELDON,PENNY
22539,I’m in bed!,LEONARD,SHELDON
22540,Go home.,OTHERS,PENNY
22541,"Well, based on what you told me, I’m not surprised.",PENNY,HOWARD
22542,Hi.,LEONARD,OTHERS
22543,"When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable.",SHELDON,PENNY
22544,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22545,No.,HOWARD,SHELDON
22546,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22547,"Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.",OTHERS,PENNY
22548,"Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?",LEONARD,PENNY
22549,"Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.",SHELDON,PENNY
22550,"Sure, let’s make it an even hundred.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22551,Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…,OTHERS,SHELDON
22552,And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22553,I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22554,I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?,SHELDON,PENNY
22555,Can I look yet?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22556,"Oh, I am so sorry.",PENNY,LEONARD
22557,Oh!,LEONARD,SHELDON
22558,Just do it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22559,Hi!,PENNY,SHELDON
22560,"All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s wrong…",PENNY,SHELDON
22561,"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.",PENNY,RAJ
22562,"Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22563,That’s an excellent question. Amy?,OTHERS,SHELDON
22564,"Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22565,I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.,RAJ,SHELDON
22566,"Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy.",HOWARD,PENNY
22567,And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22568,"No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.",LEONARD,RAJ
22569,I love you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22570,I’ll take it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22571,"Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22572,"I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.",PENNY,HOWARD
22573,"Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22574,"Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22575,Good?,LEONARD,PENNY
22576,"You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22577,Howard.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22578,You left something at home. A big hug.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22579,"Really, how does it work?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22580,"I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22581,Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.,PENNY,SHELDON
22582,"It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22583,"Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22584,Are any of them still married?,OTHERS,LEONARD
22585,"Morning, old chum.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22586,We did.,HOWARD,HOWARD

22588,Thank you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22589,"Greetings, homies, homette.",HOWARD,LEONARD

22591,By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?,OTHERS,SHELDON

22593,"Okay, good luck.",LEONARD,PENNY
22594,Thank you.. Shall I count down from three?,LEONARD,SHELDON
22595,Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?,HOWARD,LEONARD
22596,Move it.,PENNY,OTHERS
22597,"Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22598,That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You’re a doll.,PENNY,RAJ
22599,"Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact.",PENNY,PENNY

22601,Pasadena city college?,PENNY,HOWARD
22602,This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.,LEONARD,PENNY

22605,A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?,LEONARD,SHELDON

22609,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22610,Because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!,HOWARD,PENNY
22611,Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22612,"Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22613,"Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22614,What?,LEONARD,RAJ
22615,"I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.",LEONARD,PENNY
22616,But I now realize how foolish that is.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22617,What? Why?,LEONARD,SHELDON
22618,"Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22619,Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.,LEONARD,PENNY
22620,"Howie, I think you’d have fun.",OTHERS,OTHERS
22621,"Come on, Sheldon, say something.",RAJ,LEONARD
22622,"Oh, you want me to share credit?",SHELDON,OTHERS
22623,Excuse me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
22624,What difference does it make?,HOWARD,RAJ
22625,I’m listening.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22626,"She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22627,But I never will.,RAJ,OTHERS
22628,"Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.",LEONARD,HOWARD
22629,Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?,SHELDON,OTHERS
22630,"Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22631,I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22632,"Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce.  Wait! Wait! Excuse me!  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22633,Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.,HOWARD,PENNY
22634,That works.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22635,I found him in an old box.,HOWARD,SHELDON
22636,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.,SHELDON,PENNY
22637,"Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22638,The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22639,And you found somebody you could push around?,LEONARD,HOWARD
22640,Throw the damn ball!,OTHERS,PENNY
22641,Aaargh. What the hell?,LEONARD,PENNY
22642,It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.,LEONARD,PENNY
22643,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.",LEONARD,PENNY

22651,Congratulations.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22652,No cilantro?,LEONARD,PENNY
22653,I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.,SHELDON,PENNY

22658,"Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.",PENNY,SHELDON
22659,Yes.,PENNY,OTHERS
22660,"Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.",SHELDON,PENNY
22661,I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22662,I’m sharing my pain.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22663,"Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body.",LEONARD,HOWARD
22664,Squeaky wheel gets the grease?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22665,"No, she won’t.",PENNY,LEONARD
22666,"Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?",PENNY,PENNY
22667,"Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you’re going down, punk.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22668,Why?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22669,I think I’ll have a beer.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22670,"Come on, guys.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22671,Of course you are.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22672,How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22673,"Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22674,"I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.",SHELDON,PENNY
22675,"Leonard, this is Tom.",SHELDON,PENNY
22676,How can you be so racist?,RAJ,LEONARD
22677,"Yeah, tell us.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22678,"Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go.",SHELDON,HOWARD
22679,"Well, where you going, just put them on.",PENNY,SHELDON
22680,"I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22681,"All right, keep thinking.",PENNY,SHELDON
22682,"You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.",HOWARD,HOWARD
22683,"Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.",PENNY,PENNY
22684,"Sheldon, that is incredible.",PENNY,SHELDON
22685,"You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.",OTHERS,RAJ
22686,I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.,SHELDON,PENNY
22687,"I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.",RAJ,SHELDON
22688,"Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22689,"You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.",RAJ,LEONARD
22690,"You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?",SHELDON,OTHERS
22691,"Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out.",HOWARD,PENNY
22692,"So, what’s going on with Raj?",LEONARD,LEONARD
22693,"What’s the gist, physicist?",PENNY,SHELDON
22694,Bye.,OTHERS,PENNY
22695,"Well, what am I supposed to do?",LEONARD,LEONARD
22696,Not to tell anyone.,SHELDON,PENNY
22697,Why would she do this to me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22698,"Boy, if these walls could talk.",HOWARD,PENNY
22699,She just hit my car.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22700,Hah-hah!,SHELDON,SHELDON
22701,You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22702,"Oh, I love brain teasers.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22703,"No, you’re mistaken.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22704,"Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?",RAJ,LEONARD
22705,"Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22706,I don’t know. I didn’t count.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22707,"You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?",LEONARD,SHELDON
22708,"Well, what a thrill.",PENNY,HOWARD
22709,You know what? It’s fine.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22710,"Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22711,"What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?",RAJ,SHELDON
22712,Thanks for clearing that up.,PENNY,SHELDON
22713,But I think it would be comforting.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22714,"Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.",SHELDON,HOWARD
22715,"Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.",PENNY,RAJ
22716,I’m not glowing. I’m upset.,LEONARD,PENNY
22717,Paul.,PENNY,HOWARD
22718,Okay. Good.,PENNY,SHELDON
22719,"Ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22720,"Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible.",PENNY,PENNY
22721,"Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?",PENNY,LEONARD
22722,I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22723,No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22724,"That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.",SHELDON,PENNY
22725,"For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.",SHELDON,OTHERS
22726,Good night. I love both my girls.,HOWARD,RAJ
22727,"So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone.",RAJ,SHELDON
22728,"Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.",SHELDON,RAJ
22729,I did a stupid thing.,HOWARD,HOWARD
22730,Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?,LEONARD,SHELDON
22731,Judge’s ruling?,RAJ,SHELDON
22732,"Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
22733,I left them in the bowl.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22734,"Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going.",PENNY,SHELDON
22735,Sheldon.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22736,Seen it.,LEONARD,HOWARD
22737,"Oh, thank you for coming.",PENNY,LEONARD
22738,"You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22739,"Uh, do you guys mind if I start?",PENNY,HOWARD
22740,Did you get that?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22741,"Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.",RAJ,SHELDON
22742,You’re kidding.,HOWARD,SHELDON
22743,Is he okay?,SHELDON,PENNY
22744,Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22745,"Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.",SHELDON,RAJ
22746,"Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?",PENNY,PENNY
22747,Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.,PENNY,LEONARD
22748,"Yeah, well, it almost killed me.",PENNY,LEONARD
22749,What’s going on?,HOWARD,LEONARD
22750,I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.,PENNY,LEONARD
22751,Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22752,What’s the matter?,PENNY,SHELDON
22753,"Oh, look at that baby. They’re really biting, huh?",OTHERS,OTHERS
22754,"Yeah, okay. No.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22755,To what?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22756,"Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?",SHELDON,HOWARD
22757,Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22758,"I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22759,"Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22760,"Good-bye, Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22761,"Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22762,Go away.,LEONARD,PENNY
22763,"There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?",HOWARD,SHELDON
22764,"Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.",PENNY,SHELDON
22765,What?,OTHERS,OTHERS
22766,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.",LEONARD,RAJ
22767,"I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22768,"Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22769,Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22770,"Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!",SHELDON,SHELDON
22771,Penny?,RAJ,PENNY
22772,"No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.",OTHERS,PENNY
22773,Hey!,PENNY,OTHERS
22774,Way to go shutting up.,HOWARD,HOWARD
22775,"No, no, no. It’s not okay.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22776,"Well, you don’t know that.",PENNY,LEONARD
22777,It was a compromise. I lost.,SHELDON,PENNY
22778,"Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22779,"Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter’s The Thing?",HOWARD,LEONARD
22780,More?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22781,"From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22782,"Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22783,Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22784,"Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.",HOWARD,OTHERS
22785,"Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.",HOWARD,HOWARD
22786,"Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22787,To the planetarium.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22788,"What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?",HOWARD,SHELDON
22789,"Yeah, no problem.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22790,"Morning, Sheldon.",OTHERS,OTHERS
22791,"I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22792,"No, I did what any son would do.",HOWARD,PENNY
22793,And he’s sad about it.,PENNY,RAJ
22794,"Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.",RAJ,LEONARD
22795,"No, no, no. Come on in.",OTHERS,HOWARD
22796,"Do another one, do another one.",SHELDON,OTHERS
22797,Fine.,PENNY,SHELDON
22798,You know those confounded things make me dizzy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22799,"Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?",HOWARD,HOWARD
22800,He’s got a point.,RAJ,HOWARD
22801,Thirty feet.,LEONARD,RAJ
22802,"Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22803,So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?,SHELDON,OTHERS
22804,"Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.",PENNY,HOWARD
22805,"What is this, my first day?",PENNY,LEONARD
22806,What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?,HOWARD,SHELDON
22807,"Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.",LEONARD,OTHERS
22808,Such as?,OTHERS,PENNY
22809,Hi.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22810,"Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him.",OTHERS,PENNY
22811,"Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School.",PENNY,SHELDON
22812,Howard has a hairy chest?,PENNY,HOWARD
22813,What do you mean why?,PENNY,LEONARD
22814,"Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?",LEONARD,SHELDON
22815,I’m glad you enjoyed it.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22816,Truth.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22817,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn’t already know, and I came home.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22818,Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.,PENNY,LEONARD
22819,Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.,HOWARD,SHELDON
22820,I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.,PENNY,SHELDON
22821,"Come on, bestie, you’re up.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22822,"So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22823,Trying to paint a picture.,LEONARD,HOWARD
22824,"Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22825,"I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.",PENNY,LEONARD
22826,"Fine, then do it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22827,"So, what happens next?",HOWARD,LEONARD
22828,"Renaissance Choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22829,I’m sure you’ll find somebody else.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22830,Why?,SHELDON,HOWARD
22831,I think she’s smoking hot.,RAJ,LEONARD
22832,"I, I figured that out.",OTHERS,RAJ
22833,"You know, whatever.",LEONARD,HOWARD
22834,Then you’re both sad?,OTHERS,HOWARD
22835,"Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22836,Food’s here.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22837,And I think you’re cute.,HOWARD,HOWARD
22838,Right. 22.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22839,"Yes, but I was eleven.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22840,"It’s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.",PENNY,LEONARD
22841,"I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.",SHELDON,RAJ
22842,That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22843,Great. Not like regret at all.,PENNY,SHELDON
22844,Einstein.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22845,"Howie, we moved on a long time ago.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22846,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?,LEONARD,HOWARD
22847,Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?,LEONARD,SHELDON
22848,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.,PENNY,RAJ
22849,I think I’d rather go.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22850,"Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back.",HOWARD,HOWARD
22851,Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.,RAJ,LEONARD
22852,Sheldon Cooper apologized to me,HOWARD,OTHERS
22853,I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22854,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22855,Got it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22856,"Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?",PENNY,RAJ
22857,"Now, let’s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22858,You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22859,"What happens if I say, come in?",OTHERS,SHELDON
22860,"For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22861,Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…,SHELDON,PENNY
22862,Guess who’s home from the aquarium?,HOWARD,LEONARD

22864,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
22865,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22866,"She’s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?",LEONARD,LEONARD
22867,Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.,OTHERS,RAJ
22868,"Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?",SHELDON,HOWARD
22869,"I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.",SHELDON,PENNY
22870,"Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.",OTHERS,RAJ
22871,Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.,PENNY,LEONARD

22874,"Yeah, come on in. What’s up?",PENNY,LEONARD
22875,"I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?",RAJ,LEONARD
22876,"Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.",SHELDON,OTHERS
22877,"Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.",HOWARD,PENNY
22878,"Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22879,"Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22880,What?,LEONARD,PENNY
22881,Here we go.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22882,"Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?",SHELDON,HOWARD
22883,Little bit.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22884,"Well, good for you.",PENNY,PENNY
22885,You don’t need to explain yourself to him.,OTHERS,SHELDON

22889,"Oh, hey, I didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!",PENNY,LEONARD

22891,"Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22892,It’s all I could find. It’ll work.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22893,"Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22894,"If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding.",OTHERS,HOWARD

22899,Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22900,"Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?",HOWARD,LEONARD
22901,"Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.",PENNY,SHELDON
22902,Why would I join you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22903,And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22904,Do you want me to withdraw my application?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22905,If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?,RAJ,LEONARD
22906,"Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22907,We’re home.,PENNY,LEONARD
22908,I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22909,She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22910,Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.,SHELDON,LEONARD

22931,I’m hungry now.,SHELDON,SHELDON
22932,"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?",SHELDON,LEONARD
22933,"Not you, him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
22934,I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22935,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
22936,Ooh!,OTHERS,SHELDON
22937,"Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!",RAJ,LEONARD
22938,"A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?",OTHERS,LEONARD
22939,"Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.",SHELDON,PENNY
22940,"Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.",RAJ,SHELDON
22941,Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.,OTHERS,SHELDON
22942,"I know, but…",LEONARD,SHELDON
22943,"Oh, great.",PENNY,SHELDON
22944,"I wanted to. Come on, open it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
22945,You can come with us.,HOWARD,OTHERS
22946,Sure.,OTHERS,LEONARD
22947,"Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.",PENNY,LEONARD
22948,"We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22949,"Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.",PENNY,SHELDON
22950,"Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22951,Why would I be jealous?,SHELDON,SHELDON
22952,How hard did she stomp?,RAJ,SHELDON
22953,You’re not in love with Penny.,HOWARD,PENNY
22954,"I think Mrs Tishman’s got her eye on you. I’ve been there, you’re in for a treat.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22955,"Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22956,"Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful.",HOWARD,SHELDON
22957,You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.,RAJ,PENNY
22958,"Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…",SHELDON,PENNY
22959,"Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.",RAJ,RAJ
22960,The doctor says you need to get exercise.,HOWARD,PENNY
22961,"It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22962,"Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.",RAJ,SHELDON
22963,This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?,HOWARD,LEONARD
22964,"I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22965,"And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?",SHELDON,SHELDON
22966,"Yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?",PENNY,LEONARD
22967,Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22968,What are you doing here?,PENNY,SHELDON
22969,Where?,SHELDON,LEONARD
22970,Why?,SHELDON,PENNY
22971,"Okay, good night, guys.",PENNY,PENNY
22972,"A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.",LEONARD,PENNY
22973,"Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.",OTHERS,PENNY
22974,"Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22975,Nothing.,HOWARD,HOWARD
22976,Howard Wolowitz.,HOWARD,LEONARD
22977,That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.,SHELDON,LEONARD
22978,"Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.",SHELDON,PENNY
22979,"Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.",LEONARD,SHELDON
22980,"Oh, this heat is brutal.",RAJ,SHELDON
22981,Just like you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
22982,"Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!",OTHERS,HOWARD
22983,Come on.,SHELDON,HOWARD
22984,And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.,OTHERS,PENNY
22985,"Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22986,I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.,SHELDON,PENNY
22987,"Thanks, Mom.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22988,"Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic.",SHELDON,SHELDON
22989,"No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.",PENNY,LEONARD
22990,"Okay, I’m cutting. I’m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.",HOWARD,LEONARD
22991,"Me, too.",PENNY,SHELDON
22992,"Oh, sure, you had no choice.",OTHERS,SHELDON
22993,Does that change things?,LEONARD,LEONARD
22994,Thank you.,SHELDON,OTHERS
22995,"Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.",SHELDON,LEONARD
22996,Yup.,RAJ,SHELDON
22997,Ass.,PENNY,PENNY
22998,"You know, what we did, when we were drunk.",LEONARD,PENNY
22999,We’re not fighting.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23000,"Hi, Stuart.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23001,"Okay, I’m sorry.",LEONARD,PENNY
23002,"I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…",HOWARD,LEONARD
23003,"Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23004,"Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.",SHELDON,PENNY
23005,It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23006,"I know, but she’s kind of a bully.",PENNY,LEONARD
23007,"And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23008,True dat?,PENNY,SHELDON
23009,"Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.",OTHERS,LEONARD
23010,"Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?",SHELDON,LEONARD
23011,I’m sorry?,RAJ,SHELDON
23012,Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23013,"Buy him the robot, Leonard.",PENNY,LEONARD
23014,September 22nd.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23015,Bye.,HOWARD,PENNY
23016,"I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23017,"There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.",RAJ,LEONARD
23018,"Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23019,"Yeah, I do.",HOWARD,OTHERS
23020,All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.,HOWARD,SHELDON
23021,Stop! I’m going to wet myself!,SHELDON,LEONARD
23022,"But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one porn channel.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23023,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23024,"Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.",PENNY,RAJ
23025,"Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.",PENNY,LEONARD
23026,Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.,HOWARD,SHELDON
23027,"So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?",LEONARD,SHELDON
23028,"Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.",PENNY,RAJ
23029,Exactly.,OTHERS,OTHERS
23030,"Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.",HOWARD,PENNY
23031,That’s not him.,RAJ,SHELDON
23032,"Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23033,"Oh, right, it’s your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it’s all over now.",HOWARD,RAJ
23034,"Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.",SHELDON,OTHERS
23035,"Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23036,"Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care.",LEONARD,PENNY
23037,I got your back.,LEONARD,PENNY
23038,"Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.",PENNY,SHELDON
23039,You always get your way.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23040,"No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23041,So?,RAJ,RAJ
23042,"Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?",SHELDON,SHELDON
23043,"Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23044,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.,RAJ,SHELDON
23045,"Hey, I’m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?",HOWARD,LEONARD
23046,"Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23047,Enjoy having the place to yourselves.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23048,And also a little sad.,OTHERS,PENNY
23049,"Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us.",RAJ,HOWARD
23050,In what universe is that a present?,LEONARD,LEONARD
23051,"At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23052,Yep.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23053,Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?,LEONARD,HOWARD
23054,It means go straight.,HOWARD,PENNY
23055,Thanks.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23056,"Then, this is my first date.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23057,That’s amazing.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23058,"Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.",HOWARD,SHELDON
23059,"And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23060,I guess that makes me large breasts.,HOWARD,HOWARD
23061,"Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!",HOWARD,PENNY
23062,Arthur. I thought you were dead.,SHELDON,PENNY
23063,"No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?",OTHERS,LEONARD
23064,What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.,RAJ,SHELDON
23065,"Impressive, but we must be cautious.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23066,"Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.",SHELDON,OTHERS
23067,"Oh, there’s so much I want to change.",PENNY,LEONARD
23068,"If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.",PENNY,LEONARD
23069,You can always get a badger and find out.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23070,Yeah.,LEONARD,HOWARD
23071,My mom bought me those pants.,SHELDON,OTHERS
23072,"Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.",PENNY,SHELDON
23073,I’m gonna go home and take a nap.,LEONARD,OTHERS
23074,"Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?",HOWARD,SHELDON
23075,Fell asleep?,OTHERS,HOWARD
23076,You got me something?,OTHERS,SHELDON
23077,"Yeah, I guess you’re right.",PENNY,RAJ
23078,"We can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him.",HOWARD,RAJ
23079,"Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it.",PENNY,RAJ
23080,Do I really have to do that now?,LEONARD,PENNY
23081,Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.,HOWARD,LEONARD
23082,Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.,LEONARD,HOWARD
23083,"Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23084,"Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23085,"Oh, you weren’t joking.",PENNY,LEONARD
23086,Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.,LEONARD,HOWARD
23087,"He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?",OTHERS,LEONARD
23088,"Wait, meet them.",PENNY,SHELDON
23089,You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.,RAJ,SHELDON
23090,Today’s your birthday?,PENNY,SHELDON
23091,"Yeah, we can go over to my place.",HOWARD,PENNY
23092,"Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23093,"Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.",PENNY,PENNY
23094,Classy dog.,HOWARD,HOWARD
23095,Say hello to my little friend.,HOWARD,PENNY
23096,"Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her.",PENNY,SHELDON
23097,"Hey, I wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.",OTHERS,LEONARD
23098,"Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23099,What should I tell her.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23100,You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?,LEONARD,HOWARD
23101,How is that going to help them?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23102,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
23103,"Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!",SHELDON,PENNY
23104,"You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.",SHELDON,PENNY
23105,What’s up?,LEONARD,RAJ
23106,"I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23107,No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.,OTHERS,PENNY
23108,Why?,SHELDON,HOWARD
23109,Are you saying you’d like to live with me?,OTHERS,RAJ
23110,"Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me.",PENNY,OTHERS
23111,Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk.,LEONARD,HOWARD
23112,"I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23113,You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?,LEONARD,PENNY
23114,"Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23115,"That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?",LEONARD,LEONARD
23116,Please don’t be mad.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23117,But it’s personal.,OTHERS,PENNY
23118,"Yeah, you are! Just back off!",PENNY,LEONARD
23119,Underworld guardian.,OTHERS,HOWARD
23120,Yeah.,LEONARD,PENNY
23121,"You don’t have a problem with this, do you?",PENNY,SHELDON
23122,What are you doing? It’s time to go.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23123,"Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23124,"What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.",LEONARD,PENNY
23125,"Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.",LEONARD,HOWARD
23126,Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.,SHELDON,PENNY
23127,No!,PENNY,OTHERS
23128,"I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23129,Okay.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23130,"Okay, uh, let’s get things started. Um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?",RAJ,SHELDON
23131,"Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.",RAJ,PENNY
23132,Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.,PENNY,PENNY
23133,Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.,HOWARD,LEONARD
23134,"What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23135,"Yeah, eventually. She’s still not happy about taking a bottle, though.",OTHERS,LEONARD
23136,"Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.",HOWARD,SHELDON
23137,"Cherry, baby",HOWARD,SHELDON
23138,That’s what you’re thinking about?,OTHERS,HOWARD
23139,Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23140,"Once again, unbelievable.",PENNY,SHELDON
23141,Can we please change the subject.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23142,"Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.",LEONARD,HOWARD

23146,"Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.",SHELDON,PENNY
23147,"Oh, got it. We order a pizza.",SHELDON,PENNY
23148,"Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.",RAJ,SHELDON
23149,You okay?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23150,"Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex.",LEONARD,RAJ
23151,"Sheldon, this is crazy.",LEONARD,RAJ
23152,"I don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.",RAJ,SHELDON
23153,"Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.",OTHERS,RAJ
23154,"Sheldon, that was beautiful.",OTHERS,RAJ
23155,"I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23156,Just give us a minute.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23157,Oh.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23158,"What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?",SHELDON,SHELDON
23159,"Yeah, it’s also a wand.",RAJ,SHELDON
23160,"They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on.",HOWARD,PENNY
23161,"Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.",PENNY,SHELDON
23162,"Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.",LEONARD,PENNY
23163,"Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.",OTHERS,OTHERS
23164,Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?,LEONARD,LEONARD
23165,"All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23166,I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.,PENNY,SHELDON
23167,"So, how do you two know each other.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23168,"No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23169,"Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.",HOWARD,RAJ
23170,How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23171,Cobbler. I’m still laughing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23172,"Guys, listen up.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23173,"Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23174,"Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23175,Uh-huh.,OTHERS,PENNY
23176,No.,PENNY,PENNY
23177,"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having.",SHELDON,PENNY
23178,What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23179,Not relating. Go on.,PENNY,SHELDON
23180,"My apologies. Good night, Amy.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23181,"No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23182,"Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious.",HOWARD,HOWARD
23183,Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23184,Ooh!,OTHERS,LEONARD
23185,Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?,SHELDON,LEONARD
23186,I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.,OTHERS,HOWARD
23187,"Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?",LEONARD,PENNY

23193,What is he doing now?,PENNY,PENNY
23194,"Alright, well great seeing you.",PENNY,RAJ
23195,"Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.",RAJ,PENNY
23196,You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?,LEONARD,LEONARD
23197,"Too bad, I called dibs.",RAJ,LEONARD

23201,"I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?",SHELDON,PENNY
23202,"Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23203,"Oh, and we’re going to use props?",SHELDON,SHELDON
23204,"Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep.",HOWARD,PENNY

23473,How did you get paint in your eye?,PENNY,LEONARD

23481,Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.,SHELDON,LEONARD

23484,Fine.,SHELDON,OTHERS
23485,"Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23486,"It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23487,What does that mean?,LEONARD,OTHERS
23488,"Alright, and Raj.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23489,"Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!",OTHERS,LEONARD
23490,You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23491,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23492,The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23493,"People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?",LEONARD,PENNY
23494,"See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.",PENNY,SHELDON
23495,"Hey, you got a second?",LEONARD,PENNY
23496,Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23497,"No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23498,"Well, then, it’s settled?",SHELDON,SHELDON
23499,"Well, it’s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what’s new?",PENNY,HOWARD
23500,"Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!",OTHERS,SHELDON

23502,"That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23503,Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?,SHELDON,LEONARD
23504,"They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23505,"Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23506,"Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.",PENNY,SHELDON
23507,"It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.",LEONARD,PENNY
23508,"Oh! Leonard, wake up.",OTHERS,RAJ
23509,Come on.,PENNY,SHELDON
23510,"I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23511,Where’s Howard?,LEONARD,LEONARD

23513,"Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…",HOWARD,PENNY
23514,"Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23515,"Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23516,Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23517,Hello.,SHELDON,RAJ
23518,"So, you said you had something to tell me.",PENNY,LEONARD
23519,Top desk drawer.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23520,Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.,PENNY,LEONARD
23521,Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?,SHELDON,PENNY
23522,"Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.",RAJ,LEONARD
23523,"Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.",PENNY,SHELDON
23524,There might be a reason for that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23525,"Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.",SHELDON,PENNY
23526,I don’t understand.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23527,"No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?",HOWARD,OTHERS
23528,"Oh. Sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts.",HOWARD,PENNY
23529,"Oh, okay. So, what’s up?",LEONARD,PENNY
23530,"Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!",SHELDON,LEONARD
23531,I wasn’t staring!,LEONARD,LEONARD

23539,"Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23540,Hurry! We’re running out of time!,OTHERS,LEONARD
23541,"Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.",PENNY,LEONARD
23542,What?,RAJ,OTHERS
23543,"Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23544,All right.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23545,You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?,LEONARD,HOWARD
23546,"I, I think I still have it.",LEONARD,PENNY
23547,"Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.",LEONARD,PENNY
23548,Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It’s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.,HOWARD,OTHERS
23549,I think she meant something a little happier.,PENNY,LEONARD
23550,"The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.",SHELDON,PENNY
23551,Penny.,OTHERS,PENNY

23553,"Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.",RAJ,SHELDON
23554,You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?,OTHERS,RAJ

23556,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23557,Leonard.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23558,"What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over.",LEONARD,HOWARD
23559,"Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”",RAJ,SHELDON
23560,"Very mature. Keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack.",RAJ,HOWARD
23561,Then don’t ask me how I’m feeling.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23562,"Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?",PENNY,LEONARD
23563,To take me.,PENNY,PENNY
23564,"Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23565,"Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.",HOWARD,RAJ
23566,"I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?",SHELDON,PENNY
23567,"So, gas.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23568,Why don’t we go after your mother?,RAJ,SHELDON
23569,I’m sorry?,PENNY,SHELDON
23570,"How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?",HOWARD,HOWARD
23571,"Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?",OTHERS,SHELDON
23572,Oh. Nice to meet you.,OTHERS,HOWARD
23573,Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23574,Do you think it’s a date?,SHELDON,SHELDON
23575,"You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don’t you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?",OTHERS,LEONARD
23576,When was the last actual exercise you got?,RAJ,SHELDON
23577,No. You need to give me some advice.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23578,"Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?",SHELDON,LEONARD
23579,"That’s happy, right?",SHELDON,SHELDON
23580,"Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.",OTHERS,LEONARD
23581,What’s that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
23582,"Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?",RAJ,SHELDON
23583,I don’t know.,PENNY,HOWARD
23584,"Shh, I just got her to sleep.",HOWARD,SHELDON
23585,Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23586,Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?,HOWARD,LEONARD
23587,Your mother.,LEONARD,PENNY
23588,Huh.,PENNY,HOWARD
23589,"Mm, Penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for Randall to visit.",LEONARD,SHELDON

23591,"You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.",PENNY,SHELDON
23592,People. Yes.,PENNY,SHELDON
23593,"Hey, who’s ready for Halo?",LEONARD,SHELDON
23594,"Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23595,Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.,RAJ,SHELDON
23596,"It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.",RAJ,SHELDON
23597,Ba-dum-bump.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23598,"You shut the loading doors, right?",LEONARD,LEONARD
23599,"If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?",OTHERS,SHELDON
23600,He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.,OTHERS,RAJ
23601,Oh pfft.,PENNY,HOWARD
23602,I’ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23603,Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23604,But which one of us should be the party who…,SHELDON,LEONARD
23605,Well Alfred has secrets too.,SHELDON,PENNY
23606,"Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?",OTHERS,SHELDON
23607,What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
23608,"Oh, let me try.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23609,"Ah, this is fun.",SHELDON,PENNY
23610,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
23611,"Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.",RAJ,HOWARD

23613,"Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23614,"Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.",PENNY,OTHERS

23616,I would love to.,OTHERS,PENNY
23617,All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23618,"My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23619,TV star.,PENNY,SHELDON
23620,"I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.",PENNY,PENNY
23621,"Oh, sure.",RAJ,SHELDON
23622,Female jibber jabber?,PENNY,HOWARD
23623,"Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23624,Glad I could help.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23625,"I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.",RAJ,SHELDON
23626,"Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that.",RAJ,LEONARD
23627,"Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.  My mother made me take it out.  Amy put alcohol on it.  And here we are.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23628,"Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.",PENNY,LEONARD
23629,"Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23630,"Well, go faster. You’re losing him.",PENNY,SHELDON
23631,I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.,OTHERS,RAJ
23632,Hi.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23633,"Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?",LEONARD,PENNY
23634,My mom died.,HOWARD,LEONARD
23635,Bernie…,HOWARD,OTHERS
23636,"Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23637,"Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.",PENNY,RAJ
23638,"Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did, or said, or am. ‘Cause those are, like, my buttons.",RAJ,LEONARD
23639,Incredibly so.,RAJ,LEONARD
23640,"Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.",PENNY,SHELDON
23641,You’re kidding. Why would they do that?,OTHERS,SHELDON
23642,"Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn’t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca.",OTHERS,LEONARD
23643,I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.,OTHERS,PENNY
23644,Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?,SHELDON,HOWARD
23645,"Oh, yeah.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23646,"I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23647,"Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?",RAJ,SHELDON
23648,Why am I listed as your executive assistant?,HOWARD,SHELDON
23649,All right.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23650,"You do that, too?",LEONARD,SHELDON
23651,Sorry.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23652,You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?,RAJ,SHELDON
23653,"That’s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.",SHELDON,RAJ
23654,What?,SHELDON,RAJ
23655,"Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23656,"Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23657,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.,SHELDON,PENNY
23658,Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23659,This is great. What’s the occasion?,PENNY,SHELDON
23660,"I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.",RAJ,OTHERS
23661,And girls.,OTHERS,LEONARD

23664,"Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23665,Why not? Hairy Fairy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23666,"Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?",SHELDON,HOWARD
23667,"I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?",PENNY,PENNY
23668,"Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23669,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23670,"Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23671,"It’s nine o’clock, where you been?",LEONARD,SHELDON
23672,"Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother.",PENNY,LEONARD
23673,"Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23674,"So, how’s it going?",PENNY,RAJ
23675,"No, it’s okay, between  him not talking,  him talking and…  him, I’m better off alone, so,  goodbye you poor strange little man",PENNY,PENNY
23676,Hey Lesley.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23677,"Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.",LEONARD,PENNY
23678,You’re right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23679,"I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.",PENNY,SHELDON
23680,Why?,PENNY,LEONARD
23681,"I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together.",LEONARD,PENNY

23683,"Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.",RAJ,HOWARD

23685,Heated to 180 degrees?,SHELDON,OTHERS
23686,"What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?",LEONARD,SHELDON
23687,"And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?",PENNY,HOWARD
23688,You?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23689,"Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.",PENNY,SHELDON
23690,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23691,"All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,",HOWARD,HOWARD
23692,"Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.",LEONARD,HOWARD
23693,This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23694,"Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.",PENNY,SHELDON
23695,"No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.",LEONARD,SHELDON

23699,Thanks for the heads up.,LEONARD,HOWARD
23700,Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23701,I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.,RAJ,PENNY
23702,Or we could just have a life.,PENNY,LEONARD
23703,"Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.",LEONARD,RAJ
23704,Yes.,RAJ,SHELDON
23705,Yeah?,PENNY,OTHERS
23706,What do you mean?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23707,"All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23708,Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23709,I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23710,Penny?,RAJ,LEONARD

23713,"Oh, couldn’t be better.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23714,"Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.",HOWARD,HOWARD
23715,Who eats them horizontally?,SHELDON,PENNY
23716,"Yes, I believe so.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23717,It’s not working.,PENNY,SHELDON

23719,Mmm.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23720,"Oh, you’re welcome.",PENNY,LEONARD
23721,"Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23722,"Here you are, Mother.",LEONARD,LEONARD
23723,Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?,RAJ,RAJ

23726,Surprise.,LEONARD,SHELDON

23731,"There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.",OTHERS,SHELDON
23732,"Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious.",SHELDON,SHELDON

23760,"Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun.",LEONARD,SHELDON

23762,Really?,PENNY,HOWARD
23763,That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23764,I wouldn’t mind a glass.,RAJ,SHELDON
23765,"Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.",SHELDON,SHELDON

23773,"Come on, I just asked.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23774,Our pleasure.,LEONARD,PENNY
23775,Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.,HOWARD,SHELDON

23808,Excuse me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
23809,Well…,PENNY,SHELDON
23810,"That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.",OTHERS,RAJ
23811,"Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.",SHELDON,LEONARD

23818,Thank you.,OTHERS,SHELDON

23821,"Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.",OTHERS,PENNY

23842,"Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.",RAJ,PENNY

23855,"Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.",LEONARD,PENNY
23856,"Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.",PENNY,LEONARD
23857,"Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!",RAJ,SHELDON

23863,"Well, yeah.",PENNY,HOWARD
23864,"Yeah, just because you’re in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?",OTHERS,LEONARD

23866,Penny got it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23867,"Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.",PENNY,SHELDON

23876,She made him a chore chart.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23877,"Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.",OTHERS,LEONARD

23879,Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.,SHELDON,SHELDON

23886,"One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti.",LEONARD,LEONARD

23889,Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.,OTHERS,PENNY
23890,I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23891,I have no problem calling him.,HOWARD,SHELDON
23892,Wow.,PENNY,SHELDON

23896,That is a lot of cologne.,LEONARD,PENNY
23897,It’s feeling like it never will.,OTHERS,RAJ

23899,And yet you bore his child. Neato.,PENNY,LEONARD
23900,"Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.",LEONARD,SHELDON
23901,"Yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.",HOWARD,SHELDON
23902,"Oh, thank God you’re home. I need help.",OTHERS,PENNY
23903,So?,HOWARD,SHELDON
23904,"We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.",HOWARD,LEONARD
23905,Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23906,"Hey, what are you doing here?",LEONARD,LEONARD
23907,"When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!",SHELDON,RAJ

23912,What are we gonna do?,LEONARD,SHELDON
23913,That’s not your water.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23914,We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.,SHELDON,LEONARD
23915,"Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?",HOWARD,LEONARD
23916,Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.,OTHERS,LEONARD
23917,"Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.",PENNY,LEONARD
23918,Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.,RAJ,SHELDON
23919,Leonard and Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON
23920,What if he lives in your garage?,LEONARD,HOWARD
23921,"All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23922,I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23923,"Don’t worry, I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin.",RAJ,SHELDON
23924,"Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.",SHELDON,PENNY
23925,I’m sorry. May I be excused?,HOWARD,OTHERS
23926,"Not lima beans, carbon atoms.",SHELDON,SHELDON

23935,"Uh, do, do you love this girl?",OTHERS,SHELDON
23936,"Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.",PENNY,LEONARD
23937,"You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23938,Sheldon.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23939,"Well, that, that clears that up.",OTHERS,OTHERS
23940,Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?,LEONARD,LEONARD
23941,I told you. That was a different guy.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23942,Fine.,PENNY,LEONARD
23943,"No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23944,"FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23945,"Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.",PENNY,HOWARD
23946,Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23947,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
23948,"Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do.",PENNY,OTHERS
23949,I’m sorry.,LEONARD,LEONARD
23950,"Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?",PENNY,LEONARD

23956,"Wow, that’s amazing.",RAJ,PENNY
23957,I didn’t see it.,LEONARD,PENNY
23958,"It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23959,"Aha, you’re funny.",OTHERS,PENNY
23960,"Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23961,"Okay, listen, there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.",PENNY,RAJ
23962,What’s goth food?,OTHERS,LEONARD
23963,It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.,HOWARD,LEONARD

23968,"Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie’s ready.",HOWARD,PENNY
23969,"But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.",SHELDON,HOWARD
23970,"Good night, real Penny.",OTHERS,LEONARD
23971,"It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
23972,"Just say, Leonard went to the office.",LEONARD,LEONARD

23974,"No, I can’t. This isn’t right.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23975,Hmm?,OTHERS,RAJ
23976,You’re useless.,RAJ,LEONARD

23982,"Mmm, would you like some wine?",LEONARD,LEONARD
23983,"To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23984,That’s not true.,OTHERS,PENNY
23985,I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.,LEONARD,SHELDON
23986,What’s going on?,HOWARD,PENNY
23987,"Hang on, how about now?",HOWARD,HOWARD
23988,Why not?,RAJ,LEONARD
23989,"It’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,",SHELDON,SHELDON

23991,Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.,HOWARD,HOWARD
23992,My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.,OTHERS,SHELDON
23993,Then why did you have Chinese food with us?,LEONARD,PENNY

23995,"It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.",SHELDON,LEONARD
23996,I think you’re very nice as well.,RAJ,LEONARD
23997,We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.,HOWARD,LEONARD

24276,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
24277,Nice try.,OTHERS,LEONARD
24278,Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Will you marry me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
24279,"Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.",LEONARD,SHELDON
24280,Well…,PENNY,HOWARD
24281,"Hey, buddy. How you doing?",LEONARD,SHELDON
24282,"I’m sorry, go ahead.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24283,"Brown rice, not white?",SHELDON,SHELDON
24284,Thank you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
24285,"That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24286,Take off your shirt.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24287,From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24288,"My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?",RAJ,SHELDON
24289,I came to go over your alibi for last night.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24290,"All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once.",PENNY,OTHERS
24291,Great.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24292,"How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.",OTHERS,OTHERS
24293,See that? I just saved us forty bucks.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24294,"Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.",LEONARD,LEONARD
24295,Thanks.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24296,"Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?",SHELDON,SHELDON
24297,The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?,HOWARD,PENNY
24298,I might kill him right now.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24299,"Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24300,Baby’s listening.,LEONARD,PENNY
24301,"Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.",SHELDON,RAJ
24302,"I’m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?",PENNY,LEONARD
24303,I don’t understand.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24304,She’s kidding.,LEONARD,SHELDON
24305,But you love that spot.,HOWARD,SHELDON
24306,"So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?",LEONARD,RAJ
24307,You think she’s taking advantage of him?,LEONARD,PENNY
24308,Hello.,SHELDON,OTHERS
24309,I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.,OTHERS,LEONARD
24310,Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24311,I am leaving.,LEONARD,PENNY
24312,I want another one.,SHELDON,PENNY
24313,"Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.",HOWARD,SHELDON
24314,"Champagne, champagne.",PENNY,LEONARD
24315,"I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24316,You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.,RAJ,SHELDON
24317,"Yes, please.",HOWARD,PENNY
24318,"Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24319,"But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.",SHELDON,HOWARD
24320,"Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.",RAJ,LEONARD
24321,What?,RAJ,OTHERS
24322,"Hey, Stuart.",RAJ,PENNY
24323,Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24324,I understand why no-one else bid.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24325,Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?,SHELDON,SHELDON
24326,Good to know.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24327,You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
24328,That was ten years ago.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24329,No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24330,It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.,RAJ,RAJ
24331,"Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24332,I don’t see how I could.,PENNY,PENNY
24333,What?,PENNY,RAJ
24334,"Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.",PENNY,OTHERS
24335,Touche.,OTHERS,PENNY
24336,"Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.",RAJ,HOWARD
24337,"Sheldon, he’s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!",HOWARD,PENNY
24338,"She’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24339,"No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?",PENNY,SHELDON
24340,"No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.",PENNY,LEONARD
24341,Okay.,HOWARD,OTHERS
24342,Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24343,Incoming.,HOWARD,OTHERS
24344,"Okay, I got a box, but there’s no key in here. Just letters.",PENNY,PENNY
24345,"I’m good, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24346,"That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24347,I slept all day?,PENNY,LEONARD
24348,"It’s fine. It’s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine.",OTHERS,OTHERS
24349,Even Doctor Who.,PENNY,LEONARD
24350,Yum. Starving.,HOWARD,LEONARD
24351,"A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?",OTHERS,SHELDON
24352,He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.,LEONARD,RAJ
24353,"Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there’s a word for it.",RAJ,LEONARD
24354,See what?,OTHERS,SHELDON
24355,Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24356,You make a cute Green Arrow.,PENNY,HOWARD
24357,"Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24358,I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.,RAJ,SHELDON
24359,"Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.",RAJ,SHELDON
24360,"That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.",LEONARD,LEONARD
24361,"Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?",OTHERS,PENNY
24362,"Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24363,It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24364,You’re all going?,PENNY,PENNY
24365,You’re in a good mood.,HOWARD,LEONARD
24366,"Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.",OTHERS,HOWARD
24367,Hey.,RAJ,SHELDON
24368,You mean like through their window from behind a bush?,LEONARD,LEONARD
24369,I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.,SHELDON,PENNY
24370,"Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.",SHELDON,RAJ
24371,"Ah, I’d love to, but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny.",LEONARD,SHELDON
24372,"I’m sorry, Raj.",OTHERS,HOWARD
24373,"Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24374,"Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24375,No. He died when I was 14.,SHELDON,RAJ
24376,Okay.,PENNY,SHELDON
24377,"Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?",SHELDON,SHELDON
24378,Something I should have done a long time ago.,HOWARD,PENNY
24379,"Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed.",SHELDON,HOWARD
24380,"No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24381,"Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.",PENNY,LEONARD
24382,Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
24383,"I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24384,You might want to speak in a lower register.,SHELDON,HOWARD
24385,"Hey, Bernie?",HOWARD,SHELDON
24386,Yeah. So what do you feel like making?,HOWARD,LEONARD
24387,"Dill slices, not sweet?",SHELDON,RAJ
24388,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24389,Still digging the Shamy?,LEONARD,SHELDON
24390,Do not tell Wolowitz.,LEONARD,SHELDON
24391,Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24392,You love The Simpsons.,LEONARD,SHELDON
24393,Another? Great.,PENNY,HOWARD
24394,"Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24395,"Okay. Well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know.",PENNY,HOWARD
24396,I told you I’m not good with kids.,OTHERS,PENNY
24397,"Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24398,But you still accomplished something.,OTHERS,LEONARD
24399,Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24400,"Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.",SHELDON,RAJ
24401,Really? Interesting.,PENNY,RAJ
24402,"Well, what’s your plan?",LEONARD,LEONARD
24403,"Oh, well, that’s a great idea.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24404,What are you doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
24405,She won’t notice they’re missing?,RAJ,LEONARD
24406,Young’s modulus.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24407,"So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?",OTHERS,PENNY
24408,"Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?",SHELDON,SHELDON
24409,A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24410,Mmm. Mmm.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24411,"Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.",LEONARD,PENNY
24412,I’m in. Let’s do it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24413,"Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.",PENNY,SHELDON
24414,Then why didn’t you say that?,SHELDON,PENNY
24415,"Oh, I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer, I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.",RAJ,SHELDON
24416,I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24417,"You’re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.",OTHERS,HOWARD
24418,"Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen.",PENNY,LEONARD
24419,Great.,OTHERS,HOWARD
24420,I take issue with the word compulsive.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24421,So?,LEONARD,LEONARD
24422,"Oh, do you need a minute?",OTHERS,PENNY
24423,"You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating.",SHELDON,PENNY
24424,"I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.",RAJ,SHELDON
24425,Penny.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24426,"Damn, this is hard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24427,"Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go.",PENNY,LEONARD
24428,Let me help you. L. E. O. N.,SHELDON,OTHERS
24429,He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.,RAJ,SHELDON
24430,"Let’s say 4,390.",PENNY,LEONARD
24431,She stiffed you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
24432,Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.,PENNY,SHELDON
24433,"Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.",LEONARD,LEONARD
24434,"Okay, I’ll take that side.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24435,"All right, round one. Here.",PENNY,SHELDON
24436,Sing soft kitty.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24437,"Yeah, me, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
24438,And why is that?,LEONARD,HOWARD
24439,Who cares?,PENNY,LEONARD
24440,"Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?",HOWARD,PENNY
24441,I like the new look.,RAJ,PENNY
24442,Really? I didn’t see you in there.,SHELDON,PENNY
24443,"No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.",PENNY,SHELDON
24444,"Bernadette, left foot yellow.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24445,"She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24446,"Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…",SHELDON,LEONARD
24447,Come in.,PENNY,SHELDON
24448,What?,OTHERS,LEONARD
24449,You know this is all your fault.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24450,The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24451,You would go to a beach house?,LEONARD,LEONARD
24452,"Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24453,"Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.",PENNY,SHELDON
24454,She dumped me!,HOWARD,HOWARD
24455,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",SHELDON,PENNY
24456,"And with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. You’d be the king of the train store.",HOWARD,LEONARD
24457,"Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women.",LEONARD,HOWARD
24458,No. No.,LEONARD,HOWARD
24459,"Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game.",LEONARD,RAJ
24460,Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.,RAJ,LEONARD
24461,We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?,LEONARD,SHELDON
24462,"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?",SHELDON,SHELDON
24463,"Oh, that sounds like a good thing.",PENNY,PENNY
24464,Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
24465,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
24466,"No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them.",HOWARD,SHELDON
24467,Aw. What is she doing here?,SHELDON,PENNY
24468,"What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s",SHELDON,OTHERS
24469,"Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24470,What are you proposing?,SHELDON,PENNY
24471,You have to move.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24472,"So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.",PENNY,SHELDON
24473,A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24474,I missed you.,HOWARD,HOWARD
24475,You quit the game! You had no right to take it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
24476,Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.,PENNY,HOWARD
24477,"Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?",SHELDON,PENNY
24478,"No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.",RAJ,SHELDON
24479,"You’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24480,Why do you get to be Batman?,SHELDON,LEONARD
24481,Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.,LEONARD,RAJ
24482,Who?,HOWARD,PENNY
24483,"I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.",PENNY,LEONARD
24484,"It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24485,Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?,HOWARD,PENNY
24486,"Come on, afterwards there’s a Q & A with Harrison Ford’s body double.",HOWARD,PENNY
24487,Why?,RAJ,SHELDON
24488,How could he ruin the game?,PENNY,SHELDON
24489,I did shut up. Now you shut up.,RAJ,LEONARD
24490,"Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?",RAJ,LEONARD
24491,What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.,RAJ,LEONARD
24492,See? Nothing to worry about.,HOWARD,SHELDON
24493,Why is he writing to you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
24494,"FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret.",PENNY,SHELDON
24495,I’m going to work. You can come if you want.,LEONARD,SHELDON
24496,"Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24497,"I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.",LEONARD,LEONARD
24498,Gummy bears? Thank you.,PENNY,SHELDON
24499,Hello.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24500,"You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.",PENNY,SHELDON
24501,What’s this?,PENNY,HOWARD
24502,"Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.",LEONARD,SHELDON
24503,I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.,SHELDON,OTHERS
24504,"Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24505,You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.,PENNY,SHELDON
24506,Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.,SHELDON,RAJ
24507,"Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24508,A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24509,"No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?",PENNY,OTHERS
24510,You have a new job.,LEONARD,HOWARD
24511,"Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.",RAJ,HOWARD
24512,"Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.",LEONARD,SHELDON
24513,"Sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home.",HOWARD,LEONARD
24514,"Yeah, I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker.",RAJ,SHELDON
24515,It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24516,"But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24517,"No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.",LEONARD,LEONARD
24518,"Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.",PENNY,LEONARD
24519,"I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.",PENNY,SHELDON
24520,He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24521,"Okay, I think I know what to say now.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24522,"No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.",SHELDON,OTHERS
24523,"Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24524,A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24525,"There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head.",SHELDON,OTHERS
24526,Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.,SHELDON,SHELDON
24527,He started it.,OTHERS,PENNY
24528,This party’s weird.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24529,"On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.",PENNY,LEONARD
24530,"It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.",PENNY,PENNY
24531,"Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.",SHELDON,PENNY
24532,Let’s read it again.,OTHERS,SHELDON
24533,"Raj, I have amazing news!",HOWARD,LEONARD
24534,"Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.",LEONARD,RAJ
24535,Well…,LEONARD,SHELDON
24536,Thank you. It wasn’t easy.,RAJ,PENNY
24537,"Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.",SHELDON,PENNY
24538,Like a river carves a canyon.,LEONARD,LEONARD
24539,"Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there’s an Indian starving right here.",RAJ,LEONARD
24540,I don’t know. How many are there?,OTHERS,LEONARD
24541,"Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24542,Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.,RAJ,OTHERS
24543,"Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?",PENNY,SHELDON
24544,Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.,RAJ,SHELDON
24545,Uh-huh!,PENNY,LEONARD
24546,"Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.",PENNY,SHELDON
24547,"Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door.",OTHERS,LEONARD
24548,"Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24549,"I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24550,"Agreed, what’s your point?",LEONARD,HOWARD

24561,"Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.",PENNY,SHELDON
24562,"Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24563,Just grab the door.,LEONARD,RAJ
24564,"You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.",SHELDON,OTHERS
24565,So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?,HOWARD,SHELDON
24566,"Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24567,"So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?",LEONARD,LEONARD
24568,"That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.",SHELDON,LEONARD

24570,Albert Einstein.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24571,Come on.,SHELDON,LEONARD

24577,Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…,LEONARD,SHELDON

24592,Last question. What is wrong with you?,OTHERS,OTHERS
24593,"I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.",SHELDON,SHELDON

24617,Where do you get this stuff?,LEONARD,PENNY

24620,"No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.",SHELDON,SHELDON

24622,Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.,RAJ,LEONARD
24623,"Okay, I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go.",HOWARD,SHELDON

24628,"Oh, shut up.",HOWARD,SHELDON
24629,Eating a whole Altoid?,SHELDON,LEONARD

24631,"Sheldon, what’s the point?",PENNY,LEONARD
24632,"I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24633,"Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.",LEONARD,SHELDON

24645,"Well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out.",SHELDON,SHELDON

24649,She let me.,LEONARD,HOWARD
24650,"Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?",SHELDON,PENNY
24651,"Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.",PENNY,LEONARD
24652,Sign right there.,LEONARD,SHELDON

24655,"Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.",HOWARD,PENNY
24656,"Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.",SHELDON,LEONARD
24657,Where are you going?,HOWARD,LEONARD
24658,"June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.",SHELDON,LEONARD

24664,Do you really care about that last one?,LEONARD,SHELDON

24667,"Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
24668,"Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel.

24673,That must be it.,HOWARD,HOWARD

24675,How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.,LEONARD,HOWARD
24676,"A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal.",LEONARD,SHELDON
24677,"Hey, Sheldon, you busy?",RAJ,LEONARD

24714,How are the taxes going?,HOWARD,SHELDON
24715,"He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.",SHELDON,SHELDON
24716,"All right, let’s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor’s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?",OTHERS,LEONARD

24733,So? He does that every day. Oh.,OTHERS,SHELDON

24824,Hey.,SHELDON,LEONARD
24825,"If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
24826,Uh.,RAJ,SHELDON
24827,What?,SHELDON,LEONARD
24828,Are we done discussing the weather?,OTHERS,HOWARD
24829,"No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.",PENNY,PENNY

24946,Oh. Where’s Raj?,PENNY,SHELDON

24976,"That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.

25087,"You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25088,No. Not everything is about my mom.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25089,I don’t think something like that’s even possible.,LEONARD,OTHERS
25090,What’s wrong?,OTHERS,PENNY
25091,"Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?",OTHERS,SHELDON
25092,And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?,PENNY,SHELDON
25093,Hey.,RAJ,OTHERS
25094,Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?,OTHERS,LEONARD
25095,"No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25096,"Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25097,Sorry I’m late. What did you do?,OTHERS,RAJ
25098,"Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25099,"All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.",PENNY,SHELDON
25100,I hate your apartment.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25101,It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25102,I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25103,"Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.",PENNY,SHELDON
25104,"You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.",PENNY,PENNY
25105,Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25106,Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.,LEONARD,HOWARD
25107,"Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?",LEONARD,PENNY
25108,"All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?",SHELDON,SHELDON
25109,"It really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25110,Hello.,SHELDON,RAJ
25111,"Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.",RAJ,PENNY
25112,"Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25113,"Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25114,"Oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. No, he’s loving it. Yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six.",SHELDON,OTHERS
25115,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25116,"If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25117,"I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan.",PENNY,LEONARD
25118,"No, I think it’s stupid.",OTHERS,RAJ
25119,I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?,LEONARD,SHELDON
25120,Stupid Aquaman.,RAJ,LEONARD
25121,You’re not going to prison.,RAJ,SHELDON
25122,"A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.",PENNY,SHELDON
25123,No one wants to hear it.,HOWARD,HOWARD
25124,"You’re right, I’ll give him a shot.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25125,"Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25126,"Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?",RAJ,SHELDON
25127,I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25128,"Oh, no.",RAJ,PENNY
25129,This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25130,This is it.  I’ll do the talking.,LEONARD,PENNY
25131,"Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships.",PENNY,LEONARD
25132,You’re kidding.,PENNY,PENNY
25133,You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.,LEONARD,PENNY
25134,You guys ready to order?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25135,"Okay, Mom, you sit over there.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25136,That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25137,Is there a problem?,SHELDON,LEONARD
25138,I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25139,Aaaaaaah!,PENNY,SHELDON
25140,"You’re a very handsome man, Leonard.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25141,"He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.",LEONARD,RAJ
25142,Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.,OTHERS,RAJ
25143,So I’d be sitting by myself?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25144,"Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25145,I back you up all the time.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25146,"So, where should we go first?",PENNY,HOWARD
25147,"Ah, the premature I love you.",RAJ,SHELDON
25148,"I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.",HOWARD,LEONARD
25149,What?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25150,How do you know?,OTHERS,PENNY
25151,Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25152,So he’s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?,SHELDON,PENNY
25153,"Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25154,You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25155,"All right, here we go.",HOWARD,OTHERS
25156,This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.,LEONARD,PENNY
25157,What?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25158,"If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25159,"Great, what’d you have in mind?",OTHERS,LEONARD
25160,What?,SHELDON,RAJ
25161,"Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.",PENNY,SHELDON
25162,Thank you.,PENNY,PENNY
25163,All right. Pick a card.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25164,"So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25165,"We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.",SHELDON,PENNY
25166,"I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25167,"Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?",LEONARD,LEONARD
25168,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25169,"You’re not gonna let this go, are you?",PENNY,SHELDON
25170,"Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?",LEONARD,PENNY
25171,"Sure, we like fun.",RAJ,SHELDON
25172,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!,SHELDON,SHELDON
25173,"It’s okay, you can owe me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25174,It’s good.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25175,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
25176,"No, that can’t be right.",LEONARD,OTHERS
25177,"Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.",PENNY,LEONARD
25178,I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.,LEONARD,PENNY
25179,Try telling him it’s a non-optional social convention.,HOWARD,PENNY
25180,"Oh, okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.",RAJ,HOWARD
25181,"That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?",RAJ,PENNY
25182,"Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25183,"Well, everyone will think I’m weird.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25184,"Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.",RAJ,SHELDON
25185,"I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25186,"Ooh, this is a good one.",SHELDON,RAJ
25187,"Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?",OTHERS,PENNY
25188,"So, who exactly does it want to kill?",PENNY,PENNY
25189,We’re just keeping it casual.,RAJ,PENNY
25190,"Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one I’m going with.",PENNY,SHELDON
25191,"I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?",PENNY,LEONARD
25192,Come on.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25193,"So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25194,Uncomfortable.,PENNY,SHELDON
25195,"With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.",RAJ,SHELDON
25196,"Hey, Arthur. How are you?",PENNY,LEONARD
25197,Really?,SHELDON,LEONARD
25198,The new Star Wars movie.,LEONARD,PENNY
25199,And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.,LEONARD,PENNY
25200,"Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?",LEONARD,LEONARD
25201,Talk about what?,PENNY,HOWARD
25202,Check.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25203,"Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.",SHELDON,PENNY
25204,"Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic.",SHELDON,PENNY
25205,"Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.",RAJ,SHELDON
25206,What are you doing?!,LEONARD,PENNY
25207,"Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25208,"Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.",PENNY,LEONARD
25209,And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?,SHELDON,LEONARD
25210,Oh. I’m sorry.,PENNY,SHELDON
25211,Sounds good.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25212,You admit Amy’s a distraction?,HOWARD,LEONARD
25213,"I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down.",PENNY,PENNY
25214,"Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25215,"Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.",OTHERS,OTHERS
25216,Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25217,He loves that movie.,PENNY,LEONARD
25218,Is this usually how these physics things go?,PENNY,HOWARD
25219,I made some brownies. You want one?,OTHERS,LEONARD
25220,Get up.,PENNY,LEONARD
25221,"Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.",PENNY,LEONARD
25222,"Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it’s rough.",RAJ,RAJ
25223,Hey.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25224,Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25225,Do that. See?,RAJ,OTHERS
25226,"Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I’m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I’m just…",HOWARD,PENNY
25227,"Nope, it was better before.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25228,Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.,RAJ,PENNY
25229,I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.,HOWARD,PENNY
25230,What’s up?,PENNY,SHELDON
25231,"Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.",LEONARD,OTHERS
25232,"Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25233,Sorry.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25234,"Please. Ha-ha, Oh.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25235,"Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25236,"No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.",SHELDON,HOWARD
25237,"Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25238,He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25239,"No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.",LEONARD,RAJ
25240,"No, it’s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.",PENNY,LEONARD
25241,"Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?",SHELDON,SHELDON
25242,Wish I had a man like her on my team.,OTHERS,RAJ
25243,Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.,SHELDON,HOWARD
25244,In school?,PENNY,PENNY
25245,"That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25246,"Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?",LEONARD,LEONARD
25247,Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25248,"Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25249,Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.,OTHERS,PENNY
25250,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25251,"So, Amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?",LEONARD,SHELDON
25252,I’m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25253,Dinner’s ready!,LEONARD,LEONARD
25254,How come you’re up so late?,LEONARD,LEONARD
25255,"Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.",SHELDON,RAJ
25256,"Let’s hope he thinks so, too.",HOWARD,LEONARD
25257,What do you want?,SHELDON,RAJ
25258,What was that?,RAJ,LEONARD
25259,"Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25260,Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25261,That works for me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25262,"Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.",SHELDON,HOWARD
25263,"Howard’s right, that’ll never work.",LEONARD,PENNY
25264,Yeah.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25265,Another waitress.,PENNY,LEONARD
25266,T minus 15 minutes.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25267,"Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?",SHELDON,SHELDON
25268,Pardon me. Excuse me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25269,Fear of failure.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25270,"Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25271,"Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing.",OTHERS,RAJ
25272,"You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?",PENNY,PENNY
25273,What brought that on?,LEONARD,SHELDON
25274,"Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25275,I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25276,"That was fun, thank you.",OTHERS,HOWARD
25277,"When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?",LEONARD,SHELDON
25278,I’m not gonna pretend to be you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25279,"Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?",PENNY,HOWARD
25280,How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.,RAJ,SHELDON
25281,"All right. Sheldon, what’s on your mind?",PENNY,SHELDON
25282,"Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that.  Hello?",LEONARD,LEONARD
25283,That would have hurt her feelings.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25284,"I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.",LEONARD,PENNY
25285,"Good morning, gentlemen.",SHELDON,HOWARD
25286,"Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.",RAJ,LEONARD
25287,You would do that for me?,RAJ,LEONARD
25288,"Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!",OTHERS,LEONARD
25289,I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25290,"Wait, wait. What?",LEONARD,HOWARD
25291,"I know, I’m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25292,"No, I’m going to the comic book store.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25293,I think we’re gonna go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25294,Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?,RAJ,PENNY
25295,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25296,Or it’s resolved.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25297,"When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25298,I know. I saw the Tweet.,RAJ,LEONARD
25299,I don’t have one.,PENNY,LEONARD

25301,All right.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25302,What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?,LEONARD,SHELDON
25303,An orang-u-tan?,LEONARD,PENNY
25304,"Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25305,Drop axe.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25306,"Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?",PENNY,SHELDON
25307,What?,HOWARD,HOWARD
25308,I understand why you’re upset.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25309,I don’t know.,PENNY,LEONARD
25310,"Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25311,"You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25312,"You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.",RAJ,LEONARD
25313,"No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25314,Is that him over there?,RAJ,SHELDON
25315,"Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?",PENNY,SHELDON
25316,Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.,PENNY,SHELDON
25317,"Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25318,"What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25319,And we still don’t know who framed him.,RAJ,SHELDON
25320,"If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25321,"Oh, great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this.",PENNY,SHELDON
25322,Why?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25323,Fine. You?,PENNY,SHELDON
25324,I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25325,Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25326,It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?,OTHERS,LEONARD
25327,Bert has a room for rent.,RAJ,LEONARD
25328,"You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent.",LEONARD,PENNY
25329,"Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush.",PENNY,SHELDON
25330,Problem?,LEONARD,SHELDON
25331,"All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.",SHELDON,RAJ
25332,"I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25333,"My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25334,"What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…",SHELDON,SHELDON
25335,How is this lying?,HOWARD,LEONARD
25336,"We were in here first, you can’t be in here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25337,"Uh, yeah, I’d love to.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25338,What’s your point?,SHELDON,LEONARD
25339,This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?,PENNY,LEONARD
25340,Then why learn how to swim?,LEONARD,HOWARD
25341,But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25342,And I’m sure you can turn it around.,OTHERS,RAJ
25343,Booting.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25344,"Well, remember Kurt?",PENNY,LEONARD

25349,"Oh, so follow him.",PENNY,SHELDON
25350,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.,RAJ,SHELDON
25351,"I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?",OTHERS,LEONARD
25352,"Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.",OTHERS,PENNY
25353,"Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25354,"Oh, gosh, Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an actual slumber party.",PENNY,PENNY
25355,"So, is that one mine.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25356,She doesn’t know she takes them.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25357,It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?,OTHERS,PENNY
25358,"For a whole week, the nerve of some people.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25359,"You’re welcome, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25360,"Well, I didn’t until I heard that.",PENNY,LEONARD
25361,"Well, I’m glad you’re still together.",PENNY,LEONARD
25362,Weally? That’s your question?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25363,"All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25364,He’s been in bed for two days.,LEONARD,PENNY
25365,"Leonard, look! Sheldon’s hugging me.",PENNY,PENNY
25366,You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.,PENNY,PENNY
25367,Why is it always my responsibility?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25368,"This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.",SHELDON,PENNY
25369,"Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25370,"Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25371,Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…,OTHERS,SHELDON

25374,"So, how’s everything.",PENNY,LEONARD
25375,"During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25376,Mmmmm!,SHELDON,LEONARD
25377,"Um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25378,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25379,"Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.",PENNY,LEONARD
25380,"Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.",PENNY,PENNY
25381,Why not?,PENNY,PENNY
25382,"Oh, yeah, be careful.",PENNY,SHELDON
25383,"I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25384,Mm.,PENNY,SHELDON
25385,"Okay, maybe we should just end this.",RAJ,SHELDON
25386,Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25387,What?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25388,"Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25389,"Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25390,Yep. It’s officially a bro-mance.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25391,"Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?",OTHERS,SHELDON
25392,What? I was not a bully.,PENNY,LEONARD
25393,And don’t you slam that door.,OTHERS,OTHERS
25394,"Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.",PENNY,PENNY
25395,"Um, can we talk to you about Raj?",PENNY,LEONARD
25396,Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…,RAJ,LEONARD
25397,"Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25398,And there they go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25399,"Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.",PENNY,SHELDON
25400,"Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25401,Fifty cents off Vagisil.,PENNY,SHELDON
25402,"Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25403,I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25404,I don’t believe this.,LEONARD,OTHERS
25405,"For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?",OTHERS,SHELDON
25406,That didn’t happen.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25407,"Guys, fifteen seconds.",RAJ,LEONARD
25408,I was kind of hoping you would.,PENNY,LEONARD
25409,I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25410,"Hey, guys.",OTHERS,PENNY
25411,Penny would have to go into my room.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25412,Leonard?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25413,No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.,PENNY,SHELDON
25414,What are you doing right now?,RAJ,OTHERS
25415,"And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.",OTHERS,OTHERS
25416,"Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25417,What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25418,It’s in your purse. Play.,PENNY,LEONARD
25419,That’s nice.,PENNY,LEONARD
25420,I can’t. I’m naked.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25421,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?,SHELDON,LEONARD
25422,"Zip it, pervert!",OTHERS,OTHERS
25423,Thanks. You guys are the best.,OTHERS,OTHERS
25424,"The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here.",RAJ,SHELDON
25425,"Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25426,"Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25427,"No, that won’t work.",PENNY,HOWARD
25428,"Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25429,What?,LEONARD,PENNY
25430,"Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.",RAJ,LEONARD
25431,"Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.",LEONARD,PENNY
25432,She’s always complaining about people at work.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25433,Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.,RAJ,LEONARD
25434,That’s sweet.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25435,"Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25436,"God, what is wrong with me.",PENNY,SHELDON
25437,What?,PENNY,HOWARD
25438,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
25439,"Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?",HOWARD,SHELDON
25440,Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.,LEONARD,HOWARD
25441,Probably serving food that was ordered today.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25442,You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?,HOWARD,PENNY
25443,Go Sports?,PENNY,LEONARD
25444,Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?,SHELDON,RAJ
25445,How about Howard?,PENNY,HOWARD
25446,You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?,SHELDON,PENNY
25447,"I love you, Penny.",RAJ,LEONARD
25448,"Had a great time, ciao",PENNY,OTHERS
25449,"Wow, I almost didn’t recognise him.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25450,"All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it.",RAJ,PENNY
25451,Both great.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25452,Oh. Yay.,SHELDON,PENNY
25453,See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25454,We just told you.,RAJ,LEONARD
25455,I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.,OTHERS,PENNY
25456,"Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25457,"You got it, sir.",HOWARD,PENNY
25458,"Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25459,"I don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25460,"Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25461,"Hello, boys.",LEONARD,PENNY
25462,Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25463,"Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry.",PENNY,SHELDON
25464,"No, but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25465,"Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25466,Who says I’m taking advantage of them?,OTHERS,HOWARD
25467,"All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25468,"Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn’t that right, Raj?",OTHERS,SHELDON
25469,I’m on a cloud. Swing me.,RAJ,LEONARD
25470,He got a cat to keep him company.,LEONARD,HOWARD
25471,Can we please have some privacy?,LEONARD,SHELDON
25472,"So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.",SHELDON,OTHERS
25473,What?,RAJ,LEONARD
25474,What’s that?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25475,"Be right there. Hi, lover.",LEONARD,PENNY
25476,"Hey, I work at the same university you do.",HOWARD,LEONARD
25477,She sounds like a keeper.,OTHERS,PENNY
25478,"It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.",SHELDON,HOWARD
25479,"Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?",LEONARD,LEONARD
25480,"Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25481,"It’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25482,"Oh, that’s right. How’d it go with Penny?",OTHERS,LEONARD
25483,"Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25484,Okay. What is your game?,SHELDON,LEONARD
25485,"No, he would be exactly the same.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25486,"Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25487,With lime jello?,LEONARD,PENNY
25488,Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?,OTHERS,HOWARD
25489,"Okay, what’s wrong with it?",LEONARD,SHELDON
25490,"No, no, I just need to be alone.",PENNY,LEONARD
25491,"You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?",PENNY,SHELDON
25492,No.,LEONARD,HOWARD
25493,"Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important.",LEONARD,LEONARD

25499,Perform the experiment immediately.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25500,How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?,RAJ,LEONARD
25501,"I can’t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?",OTHERS,HOWARD
25502,Over and out.,SHELDON,PENNY
25503,"It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?",SHELDON,HOWARD
25504,"Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?",LEONARD,LEONARD
25505,"Okay, here’s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you’d be Summer Winter.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25506,"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25507,Thank you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25508,"No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25509,That’s the wrong box. Put it back.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25510,So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?,OTHERS,HOWARD
25511,"You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.",HOWARD,PENNY
25512,"No. Sheldon, we’re getting married.",PENNY,SHELDON
25513,"Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.",HOWARD,LEONARD
25514,"Sure, that has birds in it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25515,"And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25516,It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.,RAJ,LEONARD
25517,What about loop quantum gravity?,LEONARD,HOWARD
25518,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25519,You’re making fun of me. Forget it.,LEONARD,RAJ
25520,"Oh, that certainly would suck.",SHELDON,PENNY
25521,"Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll leave.",RAJ,LEONARD
25522,She’s not my type.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25523,"Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?",LEONARD,HOWARD
25524,I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25525,"I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25526,I was speaking to your young lady.,OTHERS,HOWARD
25527,"It is nice, isn’t it?",SHELDON,SHELDON
25528,You were right.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25529,"And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25530,What’s that one?,RAJ,SHELDON
25531,Good.,OTHERS,PENNY
25532,Do you mean that?,LEONARD,HOWARD
25533,"So they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?",SHELDON,PENNY
25534,"All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.",SHELDON,PENNY
25535,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25536,He must be very skilled at coitus.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25537,"Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?",PENNY,RAJ
25538,Amy.  Amy.  Amy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25539,I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.,LEONARD,OTHERS
25540,"Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.",SHELDON,HOWARD
25541,"Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.",HOWARD,RAJ
25542,"Ha-ha, bite me.",PENNY,PENNY
25543,"Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?",SHELDON,SHELDON
25544,"You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25545,Eight sixteen.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25546,For taking daffodils to your unicorn.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25547,"Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.",SHELDON,RAJ
25548,"Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?",SHELDON,LEONARD
25549,That’s why they’re doing it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25550,"It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.",SHELDON,RAJ
25551,I kind of already do that for Howie.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25552,"Howard, can I ask you a question?",SHELDON,SHELDON
25553,Just wait.,SHELDON,HOWARD
25554,"Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25555,"Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?",PENNY,PENNY
25556,"Oh, it is. Although.",SHELDON,PENNY
25557,Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25558,A Halloween party?,SHELDON,PENNY
25559,I have to know!,HOWARD,SHELDON
25560,"I’ll, I’ll tell you later.",PENNY,RAJ

25562,"Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.",PENNY,HOWARD
25563,"Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.",SHELDON,RAJ
25564,Killing you? I can’t breathe.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25565,And how would I do that?,SHELDON,PENNY
25566,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",OTHERS,SHELDON
25567,None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.,RAJ,SHELDON
25568,Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?,SHELDON,SHELDON
25569,"You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.",SHELDON,PENNY
25570,"So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.",PENNY,SHELDON
25571,"This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?",OTHERS,LEONARD
25572,What I need is to get to work.,SHELDON,LEONARD
25573,Now?,PENNY,PENNY
25574,"Getting a little less cool, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON
25575,Thanks. You guys are really sweet.,PENNY,PENNY

25581,Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25582,Cheers.,HOWARD,PENNY
25583,"So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One.",OTHERS,PENNY
25584,"Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25585,"Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?",OTHERS,SHELDON
25586,The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!,HOWARD,LEONARD
25587,How old are you?,PENNY,SHELDON
25588,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?",PENNY,SHELDON
25589,"I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.",RAJ,LEONARD
25590,Can I ask you a question?,PENNY,SHELDON
25591,Sorry.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25592,Hi.,SHELDON,RAJ
25593,I have no immediate plans.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25594,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
25595,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25596,"Yes, I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects.",RAJ,PENNY
25597,That’s understandable.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25598,"Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.",OTHERS,HOWARD
25599,"Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.",PENNY,SHELDON
25600,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.,RAJ,LEONARD
25601,"Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25602,Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.,HOWARD,PENNY
25603,"Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.",PENNY,SHELDON
25604,What about helping people?,OTHERS,LEONARD
25605,Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?,LEONARD,SHELDON
25606,Do you have those little marshmallows?,SHELDON,RAJ
25607,"Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?",LEONARD,PENNY
25608,"Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25609,"Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…",SHELDON,HOWARD

25614,"Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25615,He said what?,OTHERS,LEONARD

25619,"Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25620,We’re shocked.,LEONARD,HOWARD
25621,Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.,SHELDON,RAJ
25622,Oh. Fair enough.,SHELDON,OTHERS
25623,I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25624,"Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.",PENNY,LEONARD
25625,"He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.",RAJ,SHELDON
25626,"Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that.",PENNY,PENNY
25627,"Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here.",PENNY,PENNY
25628,Bam.,LEONARD,HOWARD
25629,It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.,LEONARD,PENNY
25630,"So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.",PENNY,SHELDON
25631,No problem.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25632,"I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.",LEONARD,PENNY
25633,"Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.",SHELDON,PENNY
25634,"No, thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25635,"Aw, that sounds sweet.",PENNY,LEONARD
25636,"No problem. So, Leonard, I think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you.",PENNY,LEONARD
25637,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.,RAJ,SHELDON
25638,"Leonard, I, I’m scared again.",RAJ,LEONARD
25639,"It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.  It’s Howard. Howard, hello.",RAJ,SHELDON
25640,Kind of a wuss.,SHELDON,HOWARD
25641,Hey.,LEONARD,PENNY

25643,"Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25644,Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?,OTHERS,PENNY
25645,Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25646,"I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?",RAJ,PENNY
25647,Thank you!,HOWARD,SHELDON
25648,"Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25649,"He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.",RAJ,SHELDON
25650,Cookie?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25651,"Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25652,"Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?",HOWARD,LEONARD
25653,"If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!",SHELDON,SHELDON
25654,"Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?",PENNY,PENNY
25655,"Wow, where did you learn these moves?",PENNY,OTHERS
25656,"They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25657,"Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.",RAJ,PENNY
25658,It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25659,"Okay, so, here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out.",PENNY,RAJ
25660,Your glasses?,PENNY,LEONARD
25661,Thank you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25662,"Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?",HOWARD,LEONARD
25663,"All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25664,"Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?",HOWARD,PENNY
25665,"Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?",SHELDON,LEONARD
25666,"Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?",HOWARD,LEONARD
25667,"Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25668,No!,LEONARD,RAJ
25669,"You’re, you’re right, it feels good.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25670,"My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.",PENNY,LEONARD
25671,"Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.",PENNY,LEONARD
25672,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?",SHELDON,RAJ
25673,What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25674,Well it’s not what he said.,SHELDON,SHELDON
25675,"Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25676,He wants to see I.D.,SHELDON,PENNY
25677,Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?,LEONARD,PENNY
25678,"Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?",PENNY,LEONARD
25679,How about now?,HOWARD,SHELDON
25680,"We’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25681,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
25682,Fine.,HOWARD,SHELDON
25683,"So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?",OTHERS,LEONARD
25684,What’s going on?,LEONARD,HOWARD
25685,"Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.",LEONARD,RAJ
25686,Dr Gablehauser.,HOWARD,LEONARD
25687,"Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!",SHELDON,PENNY
25688,"Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.",SHELDON,OTHERS
25689,"I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25690,"Leonard, would you be a lamb?",SHELDON,OTHERS
25691,Four.,HOWARD,OTHERS
25692,"Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.",SHELDON,PENNY
25693,"Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.",SHELDON,HOWARD
25694,"Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25695,"Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25696,"I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know millilitres.",PENNY,PENNY
25697,"But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.",PENNY,SHELDON

25699,"Actually, your name is on the electric bill.",LEONARD,SHELDON
25700,"Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.",SHELDON,PENNY
25701,We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.,RAJ,PENNY
25702,It’s numbered.,HOWARD,PENNY
25703,"Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.",SHELDON,PENNY
25704,And hate all the crowds at the panels.,HOWARD,HOWARD
25705,Which MIT did you go to?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25706,How?,OTHERS,HOWARD

25708,"Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.",OTHERS,PENNY
25709,"So, she’s just been lying to him?",LEONARD,SHELDON
25710,"Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25711,I’ll take over from here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
25712,"Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25713,"To watch, right?",HOWARD,SHELDON
25714,We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.,LEONARD,SHELDON
25715,"Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.",HOWARD,SHELDON
25716,Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25717,"Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25718,"Hey, there’s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?",HOWARD,LEONARD
25719,"That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?",HOWARD,PENNY
25720,"Okay, but just don’t fight",SHELDON,SHELDON
25721,So what do we do now?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25722,I have yoo-hoo.,OTHERS,HOWARD

25724,Men do things for women without expecting sex.,LEONARD,HOWARD

25728,": Look at that, it is a party.",LEONARD,SHELDON

25732,"Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…",SHELDON,SHELDON
25733,"Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?",RAJ,OTHERS
25734,"If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight?",LEONARD,SHELDON
25735,"I can’t do anything right for you, can I?",RAJ,PENNY

25739,Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.,LEONARD,PENNY
25740,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
25741,Why?,RAJ,LEONARD
25742,"No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable.",RAJ,HOWARD

25744,"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.",SHELDON,SHELDON
25745,Yeah.,LEONARD,PENNY

25747,"No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25748,You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.,RAJ,SHELDON
25749,"With-with loofah mitts, no hands.",PENNY,SHELDON

25759,Who are all those people?,OTHERS,SHELDON
25760,"Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a woman’s basement. I think it’s a front",PENNY,LEONARD
25761,Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.,SHELDON,PENNY

25763,"He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?",PENNY,SHELDON
25764,It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.,OTHERS,LEONARD
25765,Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?,LEONARD,OTHERS
25766,"Come on, think, Leslie.",LEONARD,LEONARD
25767,"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out.",SHELDON,LEONARD
25768,"Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer.",RAJ,OTHERS
25769,A little bit.,LEONARD,LEONARD
25770,Hey guys.,RAJ,SHELDON

25823,"You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  You would fetch a unicorn.",OTHERS,LEONARD
25824,What about Supercuts?,OTHERS,LEONARD

25855,That’s incredible.,LEONARD,OTHERS
25856,Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?,PENNY,LEONARD

26161,"Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.",PENNY,PENNY

26164,"Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26165,Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?,LEONARD,HOWARD
26166,"You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.",PENNY,PENNY
26167,"Wait. Get up, get up!  Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!",PENNY,LEONARD
26168,"Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.",SHELDON,PENNY
26169,"Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.",PENNY,SHELDON
26170,"On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26171,"Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.",PENNY,SHELDON
26172,"Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26173,"That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26174,"Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.",SHELDON,PENNY
26175,"Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26176,Seriously? You’re not coming?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26177,Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26178,"Well, can’t you drive?",LEONARD,LEONARD
26179,"Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26180,I’ll show you how to do one.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26181,Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26182,"I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous.",LEONARD,PENNY
26183,Do you really want him to write back?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26184,I wrote a paper on our idea.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26185,"Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26186,"Well, that’s it then. I’m dead.",SHELDON,PENNY
26187,"Yes, we win again.",PENNY,SHELDON
26188,"He never disappoints, does he?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26189,Psst.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26190,"Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26191,"Yes,",SHELDON,LEONARD
26192,"It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26193,Not just the finger. The moving finger.,HOWARD,HOWARD
26194,Wow. Your friend was actually up there?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26195,I know. That’s why I keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26196,Cherry,HOWARD,LEONARD
26197,"Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26198,"I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26199,Why would she be expecting me?,SHELDON,RAJ
26200,Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26201,Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26202,I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?,LEONARD,LEONARD
26203,"Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.",OTHERS,PENNY
26204,I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!,HOWARD,SHELDON
26205,Okay.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26206,"Oh, dear Lord, shush.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26207,"Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.",LEONARD,PENNY
26208,Wow.,RAJ,PENNY
26209,"And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26210,"Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings.",LEONARD,OTHERS
26211,He tried to score with Penny.,LEONARD,RAJ
26212,"I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work.",RAJ,PENNY
26213,Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26214,"Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…",RAJ,LEONARD
26215,"I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.",RAJ,SHELDON
26216,You were in the middle of an erection.,RAJ,OTHERS
26217,"I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know.",SHELDON,PENNY
26218,Morning.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26219,Is it the geometry that makes it fun.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26220,"Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26221,"Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26222,"Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!",RAJ,SHELDON
26223,"Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26224,"Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.",PENNY,SHELDON
26225,So did I win or not?,PENNY,RAJ
26226,"Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26227,Oh no he dit’nt!,HOWARD,LEONARD
26228,"Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you’re, you’re dreaming you’re watching Star Wars.",OTHERS,HOWARD
26229,"Hey, let’s light a fire.",PENNY,SHELDON
26230,Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?,HOWARD,LEONARD
26231,How is that not amusing?,HOWARD,LEONARD
26232,"And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26233,"Hey, what’s this?",PENNY,SHELDON
26234,Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26235,"The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26236,"Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26237,"God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.",RAJ,LEONARD
26238,"That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.",SHELDON,PENNY
26239,"Okay, Kurt, please.",PENNY,PENNY
26240,"Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26241,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,HOWARD
26242,"Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.",OTHERS,HOWARD
26243,"Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.",PENNY,LEONARD
26244,"Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.",PENNY,SHELDON
26245,That’s what I meant.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26246,"Yeah, it does, and here we are.",PENNY,SHELDON
26247,Bye.,LEONARD,PENNY
26248,"Uh, excuse me.",RAJ,LEONARD
26249,"I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26250,And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26251,"You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…",PENNY,HOWARD
26252,"Well, how would I know?",SHELDON,PENNY
26253,"But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26254,"Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26255,"Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf.",LEONARD,RAJ
26256,Of course.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26257,What happened to you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26258,You can do this.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26259,"Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.",RAJ,LEONARD
26260,I bet the key’s behind it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26261,I’d like to know why Penny’s here.,OTHERS,PENNY
26262,"Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.",LEONARD,HOWARD
26263,"Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26264,"Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…",HOWARD,OTHERS
26265,"Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!",HOWARD,PENNY
26266,"Oh, come on, don’t be like that.",PENNY,SHELDON
26267,"And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26268,"Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?",LEONARD,LEONARD
26269,That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper.,SHELDON,OTHERS
26270,"Very well. Oh, boy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26271,Fine. What about epilepsy?,SHELDON,RAJ
26272,Thanks.,PENNY,SHELDON
26273,What did he say?,PENNY,LEONARD
26274,"Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…",LEONARD,SHELDON
26275,"I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.",LEONARD,PENNY
26276,Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.,RAJ,LEONARD
26277,Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.,RAJ,SHELDON
26278,"Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26279,They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.,SHELDON,PENNY
26280,"No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.",LEONARD,PENNY
26281,And we lived happily ever after.,LEONARD,HOWARD
26282,Nope.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26283,"Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26284,"What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26285,I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.,LEONARD,HOWARD
26286,"Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26287,What the hell are you watching?,HOWARD,HOWARD
26288,Fines?,LEONARD,HOWARD
26289,"Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.",RAJ,PENNY
26290,Thank you for letting me come speak with you.,SHELDON,RAJ
26291,T-minus 30 seconds.,HOWARD,LEONARD
26292,Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26293,What’s that?,PENNY,LEONARD
26294,"Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?",PENNY,SHELDON
26295,Help me open it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26296,"Hi, my name’s Leonard.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26297,Uh-oh.,PENNY,LEONARD
26298,"Yes, it is. Very cool!",RAJ,SHELDON
26299,"Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?",OTHERS,OTHERS
26300,"Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26301,That’s ignition. I love this part.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26302,"First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26303,Forbaded it?,RAJ,PENNY
26304,And then what?,PENNY,LEONARD
26305,"I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26306,She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.,PENNY,LEONARD
26307,And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26308,Then he and I are on equal ground.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26309,"Great, you do that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26310,"Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26311,What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?,LEONARD,PENNY
26312,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
26313,"Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet.",PENNY,SHELDON
26314,Yeah. Why?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26315,So what do you guys think that’s about?,RAJ,RAJ
26316,"Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26317,You’re a good friend.,PENNY,PENNY
26318,"Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?",SHELDON,RAJ
26319,"Okay, you’re not helping.",PENNY,SHELDON
26320,These are my own bowling shoes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26321,It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.,SHELDON,PENNY
26322,All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?,RAJ,PENNY
26323,Bye.,RAJ,LEONARD
26324,"Fine, but don’t expect my help.",LEONARD,PENNY
26325,"Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.",PENNY,HOWARD
26326,Sorry.,HOWARD,HOWARD
26327,It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26328,"I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?",HOWARD,SHELDON
26329,Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.,RAJ,PENNY
26330,Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?,HOWARD,SHELDON
26331,"Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been.",SHELDON,PENNY
26332,Yeah.,PENNY,PENNY
26333,"Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.",RAJ,SHELDON
26334,We should let you guys talk.,LEONARD,PENNY
26335,Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26336,Stop it.,HOWARD,HOWARD
26337,Snipe.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26338,"Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26339,"Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?",SHELDON,PENNY
26340,That’s an interesting tie clip.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26341,"Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26342,Good night.,SHELDON,OTHERS
26343,I did.,SHELDON,PENNY
26344,"Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…",OTHERS,HOWARD
26345,Morning.,HOWARD,PENNY
26346,Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?,RAJ,LEONARD
26347,As do I.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26348,"Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26349,"Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26350,Sure.,PENNY,LEONARD
26351,"No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26352,"Good news, I found more Tums.",OTHERS,PENNY
26353,"If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26354,"You guys are nice, but I’m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26355,How could you say that?,PENNY,SHELDON
26356,"Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.",RAJ,SHELDON
26357,Shooting at a target?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26358,Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.,PENNY,SHELDON
26359,Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?,PENNY,PENNY
26360,"The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26361,"It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”",SHELDON,SHELDON
26362,Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.,SHELDON,HOWARD
26363,"Okay, just hang on.",PENNY,RAJ
26364,"It didn’t work for Randy, it didn’t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer.",RAJ,LEONARD
26365,"I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26366,"Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26367,Oh gets better.,RAJ,SHELDON
26368,Hello.,HOWARD,HOWARD
26369,I can. How are you?,OTHERS,HOWARD
26370,Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.,OTHERS,OTHERS

26376,Yes. I didn’t care for it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26377,I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.,SHELDON,PENNY

26379,Even Batman breaks the rules.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26380,Are you done with this nonsense?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26381,I’m Batman.,HOWARD,LEONARD
26382,All of us.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26383,"Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.",SHELDON,PENNY

26389,"Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26390,"Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26391,Cool.  Uh-oh!,LEONARD,RAJ
26392,You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?,OTHERS,RAJ
26393,Really? What do you got going on?,HOWARD,LEONARD
26394,You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?,RAJ,SHELDON
26395,"Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?",HOWARD,LEONARD
26396,"A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26397,"Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.",SHELDON,PENNY
26398,"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.",SHELDON,OTHERS
26399,Too bad. I’m coming with you.,SHELDON,RAJ

26402,"Yeah, but there was ample parking.",LEONARD,LEONARD

26412,You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.,HOWARD,SHELDON

26427,It’s a conversation starter.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26428,"Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26429,"Step one, worms.",PENNY,HOWARD
26430,"Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26431,I have a better idea.,RAJ,PENNY
26432,"Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26433,"Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26434,"You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.",SHELDON,PENNY
26435,"Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26436,How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?,OTHERS,HOWARD
26437,Thank you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
26438,"I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26439,"Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.",PENNY,PENNY
26440,"Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26441,What if we reposition the collection tank?,RAJ,HOWARD
26442,You could have stopped at “it could go well.”,LEONARD,LEONARD
26443,I’m always on your side.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26444,"I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living.",SHELDON,PENNY
26445,Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26446,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26447,"Howard, Raj. Judas.",SHELDON,OTHERS
26448,"I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26449,"Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.",PENNY,PENNY
26450,"Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26451,"Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.",LEONARD,HOWARD
26452,"Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26453,"Or as you probably call it back home, food.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26454,Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26455,And she likes you.,LEONARD,PENNY
26456,Who are these people?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26457,Hi.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26458,37.,PENNY,SHELDON
26459,"Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.",SHELDON,OTHERS
26460,Really?,PENNY,LEONARD
26461,"No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26462,Huh?,PENNY,LEONARD
26463,"Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.",LEONARD,PENNY
26464,"If you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26465,No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.,PENNY,LEONARD
26466,"Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we’re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.",SHELDON,PENNY
26467,I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.,SHELDON,PENNY
26468,You wore my pyjamas?,HOWARD,SHELDON
26469,So why was he at your party?,LEONARD,PENNY
26470,Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller’s Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.,OTHERS,OTHERS
26471,"Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26472,"It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…",OTHERS,LEONARD
26473,Bye Sheldon.,PENNY,PENNY
26474,"No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.",PENNY,PENNY
26475,That is an antisocial implication.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26476,So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26477,"But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?",PENNY,LEONARD
26478,You’re being ridiculous.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26479,"No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26480,"Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.",SHELDON,PENNY
26481,Uh-uh.,PENNY,PENNY
26482,I’ll send them a basket of muffins.,LEONARD,RAJ
26483,"Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people.",OTHERS,PENNY
26484,Does the baby have a name yet?,PENNY,OTHERS
26485,"Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.",RAJ,LEONARD
26486,Hey. Hi.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26487,Yes. I’m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26488,Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.,RAJ,SHELDON
26489,Sorry. Sorry.,RAJ,SHELDON
26490,Yes.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26491,Bye.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26492,"Sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it’s just a toy robot.",PENNY,OTHERS
26493,"But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26494,When was your last menstrual period?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26495,I reject them all.,SHELDON,OTHERS
26496,Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26497,You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
26498,"Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.",SHELDON,RAJ
26499,"And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.",RAJ,LEONARD
26500,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.,RAJ,PENNY
26501,"In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26502,Okay.,RAJ,HOWARD
26503,We are fun people.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26504,Sounds fun.,RAJ,SHELDON
26505,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.,SHELDON,HOWARD
26506,"Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim.",PENNY,LEONARD
26507,"No, Sheldon, don’t.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26508,"Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding.",OTHERS,HOWARD
26509,"So, this is accurate?",LEONARD,LEONARD
26510,Come on.,PENNY,SHELDON
26511,"Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26512,Do you have a preference?,RAJ,SHELDON
26513,You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26514,Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26515,How could you miss that?,LEONARD,LEONARD
26516,"Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26517,One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26518,So?,OTHERS,PENNY
26519,"Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.",RAJ,SHELDON
26520,Uh-uh.,HOWARD,LEONARD
26521,"It won’t happen again, what’s up?",PENNY,LEONARD
26522,"You’re right, of course.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26523,"Here, see if this one works.",PENNY,PENNY
26524,"Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26525,"Leonard, she’s doing it again.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26526,Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?,PENNY,SHELDON
26527,Hmm?,SHELDON,LEONARD
26528,No.,PENNY,HOWARD
26529,Leonard?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26530,Fine. What I did was wrong.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26531,I will.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26532,Why? Do you not want me to go?,PENNY,PENNY
26533,"Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?",OTHERS,SHELDON
26534,Hell Hounds.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26535,A lot of lectures?,PENNY,LEONARD
26536,So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?,PENNY,SHELDON
26537,I know. When will this nightmare end?,SHELDON,LEONARD
26538,"Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26539,Four months?,HOWARD,PENNY
26540,I’m very happy for you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
26541,"Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26542,"Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!",RAJ,SHELDON
26543,"I love you, too.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26544,"Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.",PENNY,PENNY
26545,"Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here.",SHELDON,PENNY
26546,"Really, so do I.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26547,"Where you going with this, Raj?",LEONARD,LEONARD
26548,"You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen.",PENNY,SHELDON
26549,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
26550,"Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.",RAJ,SHELDON
26551,"No, I’m fine.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26552,I told them I’d be honoured.,HOWARD,RAJ
26553,Great.,PENNY,HOWARD
26554,"Well, well, well. Look who it is.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26555,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26556,What a nice girl.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26557,"Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.",RAJ,PENNY
26558,"Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?",SHELDON,HOWARD
26559,"You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?",SHELDON,OTHERS
26560,"Oh, look. It’s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26561,"Seven, six.",LEONARD,OTHERS
26562,"Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.",PENNY,PENNY
26563,"Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby.",SHELDON,PENNY
26564,"Nothing, I just really didn’t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26565,What’s the show?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26566,"One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26567,"Oh, okay then this one.",PENNY,PENNY
26568,Some wine.,PENNY,LEONARD
26569,"No, he doesn’t.",LEONARD,OTHERS
26570,"What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.",SHELDON,PENNY
26571,Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26572,"Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.",PENNY,SHELDON
26573,"Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.",SHELDON,OTHERS
26574,"Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26575,"Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26576,Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26577,"You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26578,Amy?  Amy?  Amy?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26579,"Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college.",LEONARD,PENNY
26580,There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.,LEONARD,OTHERS
26581,No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26582,How’d that work out for you?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26583,"Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you’d be able to give me a hand?",OTHERS,LEONARD
26584,Hey.,LEONARD,HOWARD
26585,You guys get started.,PENNY,LEONARD
26586,So the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26587,A hotel? Did you see The Shining?,SHELDON,RAJ
26588,"Okay, let me check.",PENNY,SHELDON
26589,"Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26590,"Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?",PENNY,SHELDON
26591,Your relationship with Leonard?,SHELDON,OTHERS
26592,"‘Cause that’s all you need, right?",OTHERS,LEONARD
26593,"Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26594,Wow!,LEONARD,PENNY
26595,Maybe she was trying to send you a message.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26596,What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26597,"The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.",RAJ,LEONARD
26598,"Oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.",PENNY,LEONARD
26599,Me? What did I do?,OTHERS,RAJ
26600,"Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.",RAJ,LEONARD
26601,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26602,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
26603,Point taken. You may want to sit up.,SHELDON,OTHERS
26604,Why would you do that?,SHELDON,PENNY
26605,"Not the time, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26606,You coming?,RAJ,LEONARD
26607,Interesting. You really have secrets you don’t tell me?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26608,"Danger, danger.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26609,"Okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean, Leonard’s a great guy.",PENNY,LEONARD
26610,They’re holding umbrellas.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26611,Will you shut up?,LEONARD,PENNY
26612,"Oh, that’s true.",PENNY,RAJ
26613,"Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26614,Want to catch me up?,LEONARD,PENNY
26615,Not really.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26616,"Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26617,Ugh. Stuart.,SHELDON,RAJ
26618,"So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart.",PENNY,PENNY
26619,You’re kidding. He’s still alive?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26620,I just took him for shoes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26621,"Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.",RAJ,LEONARD
26622,"Ooh, work that thing.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26623,Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26624,"Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.",HOWARD,RAJ
26625,Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.,OTHERS,OTHERS
26626,Thank you.,LEONARD,OTHERS
26627,Yet another child left behind.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26628,"So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?",HOWARD,LEONARD
26629,The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?,RAJ,SHELDON
26630,"She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.",RAJ,SHELDON
26631,Don’t do that. What’s this?,OTHERS,RAJ
26632,"So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.",HOWARD,PENNY
26633,"I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26634,I’m Sheldon.,SHELDON,PENNY
26635,"What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?",LEONARD,RAJ
26636,Okay. What if we do this?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26637,Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.,RAJ,SHELDON
26638,"Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.",SHELDON,PENNY
26639,You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?,LEONARD,LEONARD
26640,So glad you two are done fighting.,RAJ,LEONARD
26641,Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later.,SHELDON,RAJ
26642,"Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.",PENNY,SHELDON
26643,Interesting.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26644,"How can you say that? Amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too.",SHELDON,PENNY
26645,"Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.",OTHERS,PENNY
26646,Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26647,What?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26648,"Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?",SHELDON,HOWARD
26649,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26650,You know what I meant.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26651,Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26652,"There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26653,You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26654,"Trust me, this is the right thing.",PENNY,PENNY
26655,Are you making this a tier one friendship request?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26656,"Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.",HOWARD,SHELDON
26657,And now you know why I needed the massage.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26658,"Hey, I hope you don’t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.",PENNY,LEONARD
26659,Where does he poop?,RAJ,SHELDON
26660,"Excuse me. If we’re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26661,We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26662,"It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26663,Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26664,"Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?",HOWARD,SHELDON
26665,"Yeah, you got it.",PENNY,LEONARD
26666,"Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?",OTHERS,LEONARD
26667,"So, yeah, good to see you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26668,"Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?",RAJ,LEONARD
26669,No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.,PENNY,LEONARD
26670,"Hey, what if I took your class?",HOWARD,OTHERS
26671,"Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26672,It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.,SHELDON,PENNY
26673,"Oh, you’re in a good mood.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26674,"Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I’m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26675,"Oh, there it is again! You think I’m stupid!",PENNY,LEONARD
26676,I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.,RAJ,LEONARD
26677,Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26678,"I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.",PENNY,SHELDON
26679,Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?,SHELDON,OTHERS
26680,"As a matter of fact, I do. I’m gonna comfort her, because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.",RAJ,HOWARD
26681,I don’t think I’d be good at that.,OTHERS,PENNY
26682,"You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.",SHELDON,PENNY
26683,What if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?,HOWARD,RAJ
26684,"Penny, are you okay?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26685,How else is she supposed to take it?,PENNY,SHELDON
26686,"Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?",PENNY,SHELDON
26687,What do you want to know?,OTHERS,HOWARD
26688,We can still be swashers.,RAJ,HOWARD
26689,"You pushed it, are you out of your mind?",SHELDON,LEONARD
26690,Here we go.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26691,What’s the matter?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26692,"While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.",HOWARD,PENNY
26693,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26694,"Why would you do that, Raj?",OTHERS,LEONARD
26695,"Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup..",LEONARD,RAJ
26696,Catchy.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26697,No!,HOWARD,LEONARD
26698,"Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26699,"Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.",HOWARD,PENNY
26700,"Hey, what brings you guys here?",OTHERS,SHELDON
26701,"Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so….",LEONARD,SHELDON
26702,"Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.",OTHERS,HOWARD
26703,Ugh. Can we just have sex?,PENNY,PENNY
26704,"Yes, please.  And I think it’s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find I’m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I’m a rocket man.  Perfect.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26705,"While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26706,"Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.",SHELDON,OTHERS
26707,Dr Gablehauser.,SHELDON,PENNY
26708,"Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.",RAJ,LEONARD
26709,"I’m sorry, I have to ask.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26710,"This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?",OTHERS,SHELDON
26711,With or without a numbing agent?,SHELDON,HOWARD
26712,"No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26713,"Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26714,"Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?",LEONARD,LEONARD
26715,"Yes, of course.",HOWARD,HOWARD
26716,Does he even like lemon bars?,PENNY,RAJ
26717,What? I didn’t make a sexual advance on anybody.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26718,Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?,LEONARD,LEONARD
26719,Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26720,No problem.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26721,What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26722,"Gandalf, but he’s a smoker.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26723,"Hey, what’s with him?",SHELDON,HOWARD
26724,"No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26725,What are you doing at work these days?,PENNY,SHELDON
26726,"Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?",LEONARD,SHELDON
26727,"Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26728,"Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…",LEONARD,PENNY
26729,"Ooh, meerkat fight!",HOWARD,LEONARD
26730,Walked right out the door.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26731,Really?,LEONARD,HOWARD
26732,What’s up with Ichabod?,PENNY,PENNY
26733,I can’t take this any more.  Bert.  Bert.  Bert.,SHELDON,PENNY
26734,Where are we going?,LEONARD,HOWARD
26735,"No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26736,"We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.",SHELDON,PENNY
26737,"So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.",PENNY,PENNY
26738,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26739,"Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few.",PENNY,PENNY
26740,"Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?",SHELDON,PENNY
26741,That just can’t be right.,PENNY,OTHERS
26742,"Blonde women, huh?",SHELDON,PENNY
26743,"Yeah, of course, just not today.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26744,So it’s based on your life?,LEONARD,SHELDON
26745,"They’re right, it was the only option.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26746,Was it more or less than falconry school?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26747,There’s Zack.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26748,"Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn’t want to look ridiculous.",LEONARD,LEONARD

26750,"Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared.",LEONARD,HOWARD
26751,"Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.",HOWARD,HOWARD
26752,"What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?",PENNY,LEONARD
26753,"All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!",SHELDON,SHELDON
26754,There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26755,I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.,RAJ,PENNY
26756,What’s the exchange rate.,SHELDON,PENNY
26757,"No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.",PENNY,SHELDON
26758,Sure.,HOWARD,LEONARD
26759,"Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26760,It was wonderful.,SHELDON,PENNY
26761,"It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26762,What? Why me?,PENNY,LEONARD
26763,Thanks. That’s much better.,PENNY,PENNY
26764,More often than you’d think.,HOWARD,LEONARD
26765,Wait. What’s wrong with geology?,PENNY,SHELDON
26766,"Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26767,"That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.",RAJ,RAJ
26768,"She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26769,I’m setting out snacks.,SHELDON,PENNY
26770,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26771,"I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.",SHELDON,RAJ
26772,And now you see the problem.,PENNY,SHELDON
26773,It was the heat of the moment.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26774,"Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26775,You’re kidding. An actual woman?,HOWARD,RAJ
26776,"I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26777,"Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.",LEONARD,HOWARD
26778,Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.,SHELDON,PENNY
26779,That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26780,Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.,SHELDON,OTHERS
26781,I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.,RAJ,LEONARD
26782,Right. This one might be broken.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26783,"Hello, Emily.",RAJ,OTHERS
26784,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
26785,Leonard. It’s eight a.m. It’s like the middle of the night.,PENNY,SHELDON
26786,She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.,LEONARD,HOWARD
26787,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26788,"Sheldon, this is not your home.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26789,Thanks.,LEONARD,PENNY
26790,Yeah.,LEONARD,PENNY
26791,"Don’t worry, I’ll lead.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26792,"Sheldon, this is silly.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26793,"Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott.",LEONARD,PENNY
26794,"Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26795,Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.,SHELDON,OTHERS
26796,"In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26797,"Oh, that’s nice.",PENNY,PENNY
26798,Tag. You’re it.,RAJ,PENNY
26799,"Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.",PENNY,OTHERS
26800,Thanks. You got to be kidding me.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26801,"Hi, Sheldon.",OTHERS,PENNY
26802,"Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26803,"Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?",LEONARD,PENNY
26804,"Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.",PENNY,LEONARD
26805,Come on.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26806,"True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26807,I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26808,He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?,HOWARD,LEONARD
26809,"Guys, there are four of us and one of him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26810,You’re the other baby.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26811,No. Maybe. I don’t know.,PENNY,SHELDON
26812,"So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?",HOWARD,PENNY
26813,"Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?",PENNY,RAJ
26814,Morning.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26815,I like Cinderella.,OTHERS,LEONARD

26817,I am not a crybaby.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26818,Right.,LEONARD,HOWARD
26819,"No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?",HOWARD,SHELDON
26820,A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26821,"So not funny, dad.",PENNY,SHELDON
26822,"Well, of course not.",LEONARD,PENNY
26823,Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.,PENNY,LEONARD
26824,Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26825,Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26826,I don’t.,OTHERS,HOWARD
26827,Maybe we pick names out of a hat.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26828,"Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?",PENNY,PENNY
26829,Might be something to think about.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26830,But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26831,"Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There’s going to be a scene depicting Spock’s birth.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26832,Oh! Hello.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26833,Mandy Chao?,SHELDON,PENNY
26834,I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.,OTHERS,HOWARD
26835,"I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?",RAJ,HOWARD

26842,"Sheldon, that’s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26843,"I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.",SHELDON,RAJ
26844,Really? They didn’t eat him?,OTHERS,PENNY
26845,"What, you wouldn’t trust him?",PENNY,SHELDON
26846,She makes more money than I do.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26847,"Hey, I was just… what is happening?",LEONARD,HOWARD
26848,"No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26849,You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?,PENNY,SHELDON
26850,That is not true.,PENNY,PENNY
26851,When they perfect human cloning I’m going to order twelve of those.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26852,"Oh, I don’t think I could do that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26853,So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?,LEONARD,RAJ
26854,"Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26855,"Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26856,"Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?",RAJ,SHELDON
26857,"No Sheldon, I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.",PENNY,SHELDON
26858,"No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26859,S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.,LEONARD,PENNY
26860,Really? You always seem so confident.,PENNY,RAJ
26861,"Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?",PENNY,OTHERS

26863,"Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?",PENNY,PENNY
26864,What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?,HOWARD,SHELDON
26865,You might not want to do that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26866,Hi Penny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26867,"No, they said I was too perky.",PENNY,SHELDON
26868,"That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.",HOWARD,LEONARD
26869,You’re not helping.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26870,All righty.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26871,"Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.",PENNY,PENNY
26872,You’re welcome.,PENNY,SHELDON
26873,"All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?",OTHERS,LEONARD
26874,"Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.",HOWARD,SHELDON

26878,"Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26879,"Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26880,"Sheldon, what do you want?",PENNY,RAJ
26881,Then why did you say it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26882,It’s one onion ring.,PENNY,SHELDON
26883,I got a Gryffindor robe for you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
26884,"Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?",PENNY,SHELDON
26885,"Sorry, Officer.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26886,"Boy, that was a long night for me.",OTHERS,LEONARD
26887,No! Not enchanted bunny!,RAJ,SHELDON
26888,Anything.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26889,That’s for the fire marshal to determine.,SHELDON,SHELDON
26890,Ah!,LEONARD,LEONARD
26891,"I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
26892,"Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…",LEONARD,SHELDON
26893,He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.,LEONARD,LEONARD
26894,"In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?",PENNY,SHELDON
26895,"Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26896,"Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous.",LEONARD,OTHERS
26897,"Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.",SHELDON,RAJ
26898,"Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26899,That should have been my first clue.,LEONARD,SHELDON
26900,You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26901,"Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?",PENNY,SHELDON
26902,"It’s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian",PENNY,RAJ
26903,"I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.",SHELDON,SHELDON
26904,Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?,LEONARD,LEONARD
26905,"Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26906,"Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?",SHELDON,LEONARD
26907,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
26908,"Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.",RAJ,PENNY
26909,Look at Amy down there. Should we go?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26910,"Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it.",LEONARD,PENNY
26911,"Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?",HOWARD,HOWARD
26912,"Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26913,"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.",SHELDON,PENNY
26914,"Wow, that’s harsh.",RAJ,HOWARD
26915,"Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26916,"Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down.",SHELDON,PENNY
26917,"Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26918,I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.,OTHERS,LEONARD
26919,Fire away.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26920,"Actually, I’m hanging out with Penny.",LEONARD,PENNY
26921,Even more not what you think.,PENNY,SHELDON
26922,"It’s a little early, isn’t it?",RAJ,LEONARD
26923,I see. Is that decision open for discussion?,SHELDON,PENNY
26924,"Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?",PENNY,LEONARD
26925,To give to you.,OTHERS,PENNY
26926,"Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26927,"Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.",SHELDON,SHELDON

26929,"I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing.",OTHERS,SHELDON
26930,Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.,HOWARD,SHELDON
26931,"Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?",RAJ,LEONARD
26932,"Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?",RAJ,LEONARD
26933,"Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.",PENNY,SHELDON
26934,What’s that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
26935,"Actually, I’m still here.",RAJ,HOWARD
26936,"I’m not in the mood, Sheldon.",LEONARD,RAJ
26937,Really? You won’t even say A?,PENNY,RAJ
26938,"An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.",SHELDON,HOWARD
26939,Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.,PENNY,PENNY
26940,I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  I guess I can wait for the DVD.  And then never ever watch it.,SHELDON,PENNY
26941,"Yeah, so?",PENNY,PENNY
26942,"No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.",LEONARD,SHELDON
26943,"No, not really.",RAJ,RAJ
26944,"Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.",PENNY,SHELDON
26945,What am I supposed to say?,PENNY,SHELDON
26946,I know where my feet have been.,SHELDON,LEONARD
26947,Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?,SHELDON,LEONARD
26948,"I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.",RAJ,SHELDON
26949,What’s the matter?,HOWARD,SHELDON
26950,"I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?",SHELDON,SHELDON
26951,"Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here.",SHELDON,LEONARD
26952,"Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?",LEONARD,HOWARD

26958,And Orcs!,LEONARD,LEONARD

26962,Joke?,OTHERS,SHELDON
26963,Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?,SHELDON,SHELDON
26964,Why at my place?,LEONARD,LEONARD

26969,No.,PENNY,SHELDON
26970,"At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.",OTHERS,HOWARD

26973,"Thanks, Mom.You’re the best.",SHELDON,PENNY

26975,"Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?",PENNY,SHELDON

27012,I don’t know how I feel about this.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27013,That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.,RAJ,LEONARD
27014,So what happens when it counts down?,OTHERS,LEONARD
27015,"Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27016,"Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27017,You could be a little more into it.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27018,Why is it odd?,LEONARD,HOWARD
27019,Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?,SHELDON,OTHERS
27020,"He still won’t shag the old lady, huh?",PENNY,SHELDON
27021,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27022,"Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27023,Right.,LEONARD,PENNY

27030,"Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27031,I’m sorry. I’m not here.,PENNY,SHELDON
27032,"Oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!",PENNY,LEONARD

27034,"Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?",HOWARD,SHELDON
27035,"How’s it going, Sheldon?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27036,"Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27037,I already do.,SHELDON,SHELDON

27041,You’re really going without me?,SHELDON,PENNY
27042,Magic wand TV remote?,RAJ,LEONARD
27043,That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27044,I’ll help you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27045,"If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27046,Better?,RAJ,SHELDON
27047,All right. Hello.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27048,I see you’re drinking wine.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27049,I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.,OTHERS,RAJ
27050,It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.,SHELDON,LEONARD

27056,Thank you. How about a hug?,PENNY,PENNY
27057,"Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27058,"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.",SHELDON,PENNY
27059,"Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.",SHELDON,PENNY
27060,"Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.",RAJ,LEONARD

27086,"If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27087,"Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27088,I’ll be right back.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27089,"Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27090,"Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!",OTHERS,HOWARD
27091,No. Were you seeing other men?,HOWARD,PENNY
27092,Uh-huh!,PENNY,SHELDON
27093,"Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27094,"Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again.",SHELDON,RAJ
27095,"Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on.",PENNY,SHELDON
27096,You forbid it?,LEONARD,OTHERS
27097,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27098,"On three. One, two, three.",HOWARD,HOWARD

27114,"If you do good job, next time we give you brush.",OTHERS,PENNY
27115,"Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.",PENNY,SHELDON
27116,Do you sleep in tents?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27117,"The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27118,Hello.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27119,"Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27120,He’s right.,RAJ,SHELDON
27121,I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.,SHELDON,HOWARD

27123,"Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?",SHELDON,SHELDON
27124,Are you doing okay?,PENNY,SHELDON
27125,"Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.",RAJ,SHELDON
27126,"You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27127,"Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?",PENNY,SHELDON
27128,"Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?",LEONARD,RAJ
27129,Thank you for wearing your heels.,PENNY,SHELDON

27135,Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.,LEONARD,OTHERS
27136,When did you learn how to pick locks?,RAJ,SHELDON
27137,No. It’s a little tricky. I’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…,HOWARD,RAJ
27138,"Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.",PENNY,RAJ
27139,Sheldon! Play nice.,PENNY,LEONARD
27140,What’s the occasion?,SHELDON,LEONARD
27141,How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27142,Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27143,"Raj, what about you?",PENNY,LEONARD
27144,"Because you didn’t keep true.  Okay, turn right.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27145,"But Raj is from India, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27146,"So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27147,"I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!",SHELDON,OTHERS
27148,"Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27149,You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27150,Howard.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27151,I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27152,And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.,HOWARD,SHELDON

27157,What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27158,"Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.",OTHERS,PENNY

27166,"Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that.",SHELDON,PENNY
27167,"Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone.",PENNY,LEONARD
27168,Why?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27169,That’s enough.,PENNY,SHELDON
27170,"Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.",PENNY,SHELDON

27172,You want to hear my Stuart? It’s been a while since I’ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?,HOWARD,SHELDON
27173,Hang on.,PENNY,SHELDON
27174,Hey. Off to work?,LEONARD,HOWARD
27175,"I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27176,"Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27177,"Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.",PENNY,SHELDON
27178,"Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?",LEONARD,LEONARD
27179,You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?,OTHERS,HOWARD

27204,That sounds really nice.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27205,Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?,LEONARD,PENNY
27206,They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.,SHELDON,LEONARD

27208,Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27209,"Sheldon, I know what I’m doing.",HOWARD,OTHERS
27210,I didn’t do the audition.,PENNY,HOWARD

27234,I’m driving the car. I need to know.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27235,"No, not at all.",PENNY,LEONARD
27236,"No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.",RAJ,LEONARD
27237,It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27238,"So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27239,That’s what he said to me.,RAJ,RAJ
27240,We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.,RAJ,PENNY
27241,That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?,LEONARD,PENNY
27242,"Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you.",SHELDON,RAJ
27243,I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.,SHELDON,HOWARD
27244,Hey. What’re you working on?,LEONARD,PENNY
27245,"Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27246,"I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27247,"No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?",PENNY,SHELDON
27248,Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?,OTHERS,RAJ
27249,"You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!",OTHERS,PENNY
27250,"Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.",PENNY,LEONARD
27251,"Okay, you, too.",PENNY,SHELDON
27252,"I’m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27253,"They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27254,"Hey, Daddy.",PENNY,SHELDON
27255,Damn it.,PENNY,OTHERS
27256,"Plus, no one stole their pants.",RAJ,OTHERS
27257,"Oh, Bella, don’t you see? Edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you.  Coming.",RAJ,SHELDON
27258,"Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?",OTHERS,RAJ
27259,"Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.",PENNY,SHELDON
27260,I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.,RAJ,LEONARD
27261,"One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.",OTHERS,PENNY
27262,"Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.",RAJ,LEONARD
27263,There are no solar flares right now.,RAJ,PENNY
27264,"Damn, okay, I’ll just take the roof.",PENNY,OTHERS
27265,Almost.,LEONARD,OTHERS
27266,Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27267,Have you tried letting go of the rope?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27268,Lay it on me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27269,Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27270,Disgusting. Do not tell him.,PENNY,LEONARD
27271,Why does she get that? We never got that.,LEONARD,PENNY
27272,Um…,LEONARD,SHELDON
27273,"Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?",LEONARD,RAJ
27274,Are we overthinking this?,LEONARD,LEONARD
27275,What’s so funny?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27276,"Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27277,"I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though.",OTHERS,RAJ
27278,"Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.",RAJ,PENNY
27279,It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.,PENNY,PENNY
27280,What did he say?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27281,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.,RAJ,SHELDON
27282,Why?,SHELDON,PENNY
27283,"So, you see it too.",SHELDON,PENNY
27284,Alone?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27285,"Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27286,"Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27287,"Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.",OTHERS,OTHERS
27288,Aw.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27289,"So, what kind of research are you doing?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27290,"Oh, cool.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27291,"Happy birthday, Sherman.",OTHERS,OTHERS
27292,"Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.",RAJ,SHELDON
27293,"No, just the one. But it’s really long.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27294,"So does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27295,"My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.",LEONARD,HOWARD
27296,Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27297,I’m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.,RAJ,RAJ
27298,I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.,RAJ,SHELDON
27299,Scrotum.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27300,Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.,SHELDON,HOWARD
27301,"Uh, cut it in half?",LEONARD,LEONARD
27302,Are we so sure that’s a bad thing?,PENNY,SHELDON
27303,"Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see  a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble’s constant.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27304,"So, afternoon tea was a bust.",PENNY,PENNY
27305,Is everything all right?,LEONARD,OTHERS
27306,"Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?",LEONARD,SHELDON
27307,Can we please move this along?,HOWARD,LEONARD
27308,You’re just making fun of me.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27309,"But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27310,"You look, you look really pretty tonight.",RAJ,SHELDON
27311,Is something going on?,OTHERS,PENNY
27312,"You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27313,"Wow, cool tiger.",PENNY,LEONARD
27314,"I’m sorry, I’ll start again.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27315,"Well of course I… oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let’s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27316,I’m already on vibrate.,HOWARD,HOWARD
27317,"Aw, you didn’t have to do that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27318,What are you doing? Use the door.,LEONARD,RAJ
27319,What?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27320,Where were you?,HOWARD,SHELDON
27321,"Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27322,"What does that mean, under your bed?",LEONARD,HOWARD
27323,"Yeah, so what?",RAJ,SHELDON
27324,"I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.",OTHERS,PENNY
27325,"Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.",LEONARD,RAJ
27326,"Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.",HOWARD,PENNY
27327,Hand me the tuna melt.,HOWARD,PENNY
27328,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.,LEONARD,PENNY
27329,How’s Bernadette?,OTHERS,LEONARD
27330,"After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.",HOWARD,RAJ
27331,"Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?",RAJ,PENNY
27332,Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.,PENNY,SHELDON
27333,"I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t.",SHELDON,PENNY
27334,Did you take dance lessons?,PENNY,SHELDON
27335,"Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.",SHELDON,RAJ
27336,"I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s new assistant.",OTHERS,PENNY
27337,Morning.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27338,"Amy, what are you doing here?",LEONARD,SHELDON
27339,I’m in the middle of something.,HOWARD,HOWARD
27340,"Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27341,I wish there were more.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27342,"Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?",LEONARD,LEONARD
27343,"Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.",SHELDON,PENNY
27344,"What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.",RAJ,OTHERS
27345,"After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.",LEONARD,PENNY
27346,All right.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27347,"Sure, sure.",PENNY,SHELDON
27348,"Fine, what do you want me to do?",SHELDON,SHELDON
27349,Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.,LEONARD,OTHERS
27350,Where’s Howard?,SHELDON,LEONARD
27351,"This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27352,"Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.",OTHERS,PENNY
27353,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27354,I sure hope so.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27355,Isn’t this nice?,SHELDON,HOWARD
27356,It’s a big fort.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27357,What is it to you?,RAJ,LEONARD
27358,"Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.",RAJ,LEONARD
27359,Dr. Sheldon Cooper?,PENNY,SHELDON
27360,Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?,OTHERS,OTHERS
27361,Isn’t that flammable?,LEONARD,PENNY
27362,"Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27363,Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?,OTHERS,RAJ
27364,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27365,Next year I’m going to Epcot.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27366,"Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27367,I think we’re all talking to Penny here.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27368,No music it is.,PENNY,HOWARD
27369,"You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.",SHELDON,RAJ
27370,"You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27371,"Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off.",LEONARD,HOWARD
27372,I’m furious.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27373,"Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?",PENNY,LEONARD
27374,"That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27375,Seriously?,HOWARD,PENNY
27376,Are you sure?,HOWARD,LEONARD
27377,"Oh, no, what happened?",PENNY,SHELDON
27378,"Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.",RAJ,SHELDON
27379,Hmm-hmm.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27380,"Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesn’t want to talk.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27381,And you actually got in a pool?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27382,Aha.,RAJ,HOWARD
27383,"If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?",PENNY,HOWARD
27384,"No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face.",OTHERS,PENNY
27385,"No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around.",LEONARD,PENNY
27386,"Well, I’m sorry.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27387,In the lab?,SHELDON,PENNY
27388,"Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?",RAJ,LEONARD
27389,Sure.,OTHERS,PENNY
27390,"Okay, if you insist.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27391,"Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first.",PENNY,OTHERS
27392,Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27393,What the hell is wrong with you?,PENNY,LEONARD
27394,"Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27395,I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.,LEONARD,RAJ
27396,"No red and yellow, no red and yellow.",HOWARD,PENNY
27397,"Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.",PENNY,PENNY
27398,"Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27399,"Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.",PENNY,LEONARD
27400,"Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…",PENNY,SHELDON
27401,Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?,OTHERS,RAJ
27402,No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27403,Thank you.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27404,"Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27405,I’m going to bed.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27406,"Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27407,Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.,SHELDON,HOWARD
27408,I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27409,‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?,PENNY,SHELDON
27410,"Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.",PENNY,LEONARD
27411,"Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.",RAJ,SHELDON
27412,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.",RAJ,LEONARD
27413,"Yeah, so?",LEONARD,HOWARD
27414,"Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.",RAJ,PENNY
27415,"No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.",PENNY,HOWARD
27416,"Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27417,"Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27418,"Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.",RAJ,LEONARD
27419,I respect that.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27420,"Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count.",SHELDON,PENNY
27421,Because we don’t live here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27422,"No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off.",LEONARD,HOWARD
27423,"I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27424,But it’s an expression of our love.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27425,That’s humorous.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27426,"You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27427,"Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…",SHELDON,PENNY
27428,"That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?",HOWARD,PENNY
27429,"Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27430,"Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?",LEONARD,SHELDON
27431,"Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27432,"Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order.  See? Sorry.",PENNY,LEONARD
27433,I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.,RAJ,PENNY
27434,Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27435,"See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27436,"To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27437,"Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.",PENNY,LEONARD
27438,"Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it’s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.",RAJ,SHELDON
27439,"Just don’t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!",OTHERS,OTHERS
27440,That’s actually funny.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27441,Why would I change?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27442,Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27443,Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?,OTHERS,OTHERS
27444,"Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?",SHELDON,SHELDON
27445,"I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27446,"Okay, that’s the one to beat.",PENNY,HOWARD
27447,"Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.",PENNY,PENNY
27448,"Yeah, probably.",PENNY,SHELDON
27449,It was before my growth spurt.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27450,"No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27451,"Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.",RAJ,LEONARD
27452,Hi.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27453,"I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad.",OTHERS,PENNY
27454,"Good morning, slut.",PENNY,SHELDON
27455,"Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27456,Hmm. What are you doing now?,SHELDON,LEONARD
27457,"Sheldon, it’s me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27458,Hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
27459,Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27460,Santa?,SHELDON,HOWARD
27461,But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.,LEONARD,PENNY
27462,"Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27463,He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.,OTHERS,PENNY
27464,You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.,RAJ,SHELDON
27465,"So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.",RAJ,SHELDON
27466,That’s great.,PENNY,PENNY
27467,Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27468,"Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27469,How?,LEONARD,LEONARD
27470,You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.,RAJ,SHELDON
27471,Are you just getting home?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27472,"Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27473,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27474,Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27475,"Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27476,"Well, that depends.",PENNY,LEONARD
27477,Hi.,PENNY,PENNY
27478,"So, are you gonna see her again?",LEONARD,PENNY
27479,"Mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?",HOWARD,PENNY
27480,Fo’ shizzle.,RAJ,LEONARD
27481,"No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27482,"Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.",SHELDON,RAJ
27483,"Well, we all have a past.",OTHERS,HOWARD
27484,"I know. It’s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27485,"Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27486,You mean for someone who’s into comic books?,LEONARD,OTHERS
27487,The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different.,SHELDON,OTHERS
27488,"Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27489,"Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.",PENNY,LEONARD
27490,So erase them and walk out.,PENNY,HOWARD
27491,"Well, this isn’t an easy time for him. He’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27492,Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn’t moving.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27493,"Well, today we tried masturbating for money.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27494,"Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.",SHELDON,PENNY
27495,"Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you.",LEONARD,PENNY
27496,"Uh, guys, we’re locked in here.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27497,How did you know I was here?,PENNY,SHELDON
27498,"Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27499,"I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.",LEONARD,OTHERS
27500,Ooh!,OTHERS,SHELDON
27501,"I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her blog.",RAJ,LEONARD
27502,Be right back.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27503,What do you want from me?,PENNY,SHELDON
27504,There is no season three. They cancelled that show.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27505,That’s the one to beat. Leonard?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27506,"I’m aware of that, sir.",HOWARD,PENNY
27507,"Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work.",PENNY,PENNY

27509,That’s more like it.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27510,"Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad.",PENNY,SHELDON
27511,You can’t come in.,RAJ,LEONARD
27512,"Oh, looks like it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27513,No Penny?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27514,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,PENNY
27515,Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?,PENNY,HOWARD
27516,"Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?",LEONARD,PENNY
27517,Did Bernadette think it was cool?,RAJ,SHELDON
27518,"Telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?",PENNY,OTHERS
27519,Penny?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27520,When did you and Leonard break up?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27521,It’s very simple. This is A  this is B  this is C…,SHELDON,LEONARD
27522,Sheldon?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27523,I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.,RAJ,SHELDON
27524,Great. What are you going to do first?,LEONARD,LEONARD
27525,"So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?",PENNY,LEONARD
27526,We’re starting now!,HOWARD,RAJ
27527,"You know, the Bible says forgiveness…",OTHERS,SHELDON
27528,"My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  No, I think we’ll have to return the car.  And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.",RAJ,LEONARD
27529,"Oh, an Euler’s Disk, fun.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27530,But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.,RAJ,LEONARD
27531,"Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.",HOWARD,PENNY
27532,What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27533,Yeah?,PENNY,LEONARD
27534,"I mean, it’s not, like, HD quality.",HOWARD,RAJ
27535,That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27536,See what happens when you work hard?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27537,"Come on, Raj.",HOWARD,PENNY
27538,"And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27539,A dolphin might.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27540,What?,LEONARD,RAJ
27541,I love it.,LEONARD,PENNY
27542,"Yeah, he deserves to be alone.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27543,Did it occur to you that was by design?,SHELDON,LEONARD
27544,Oh. Sure. Absolutely.,LEONARD,PENNY
27545,What are you doing?,RAJ,SHELDON
27546,Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?,RAJ,SHELDON
27547,I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27548,What alibi?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27549,"Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…",RAJ,SHELDON
27550,"Oh, God, never again.",RAJ,PENNY
27551,"Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?",SHELDON,RAJ
27552,"If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27553,"Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.",RAJ,LEONARD
27554,Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.,HOWARD,HOWARD
27555,"Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here.",HOWARD,PENNY
27556,"Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.",SHELDON,RAJ
27557,"Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?",OTHERS,RAJ
27558,"Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.",RAJ,SHELDON
27559,"Oh, better than good.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27560,"No, no.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27561,"Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here.",PENNY,OTHERS
27562,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
27563,Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.,PENNY,PENNY
27564,"Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.",SHELDON,PENNY
27565,"Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27566,I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27567,"Yeah, no, I don’t think so.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27568,Done.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27569,"Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.",SHELDON,RAJ
27570,"No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27571,"Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27572,"You said it, not me.",SHELDON,RAJ
27573,You can’t find a card that says that?,LEONARD,OTHERS
27574,I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren.,LEONARD,PENNY
27575,"Uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27576,You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.,SHELDON,PENNY
27577,Very well.,RAJ,SHELDON
27578,Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?,HOWARD,LEONARD
27579,Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.,SHELDON,OTHERS
27580,"For what it’s worth, you’re a great liar.",OTHERS,PENNY
27581,"I don’t go to school, Ma. I work at a university.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27582,"Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge.",SHELDON,PENNY
27583,"Yeah, it’s from Changs.",LEONARD,HOWARD
27584,"Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”",SHELDON,PENNY
27585,Sorry. Howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27586,"Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.",LEONARD,HOWARD
27587,Why are you speaking Klingon?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27588,Yes.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27589,"You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27590,"I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27591,I smell funny. I taste salty.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27592,"Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.",LEONARD,PENNY
27593,"A little jealous, are we?",HOWARD,SHELDON
27594,"It didn’t hurt, did it?",OTHERS,LEONARD
27595,"Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!",HOWARD,PENNY
27596,"It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27597,"If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27598,Sheldon Cooper does not cry.,SHELDON,RAJ
27599,"If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break.",LEONARD,HOWARD
27600,I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.,OTHERS,RAJ
27601,"Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?",HOWARD,SHELDON
27602,"Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be",OTHERS,SHELDON
27603,Sad?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27604,Flags.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27605,"Well, actually, he, he already did.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27606,Good.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27607,It wasn’t a time-out. Let’s get some food.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27608,Since when?,LEONARD,OTHERS
27609,"Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.",PENNY,PENNY
27610,"Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27611,"You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.",HOWARD,RAJ
27612,Could you tell us?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27613,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27614,"I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!",OTHERS,HOWARD
27615,"Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?",OTHERS,LEONARD
27616,"Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?",OTHERS,LEONARD
27617,"Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27618,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
27619,PS4.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27620,"Anyway, I know it’s silly, but since Raj moved in, I’ve been feeling a little left out.",LEONARD,OTHERS
27621,"Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27622,How’s that?,PENNY,LEONARD
27623,"Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.",RAJ,LEONARD
27624,Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.,SHELDON,RAJ
27625,"All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.",PENNY,PENNY
27626,"So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What the heck was all that about?”",HOWARD,LEONARD
27627,"Come on, scrub it up, Loops.",OTHERS,HOWARD
27628,Where?,RAJ,RAJ
27629,What’s going on?,PENNY,PENNY
27630,"The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27631,"Soft kitty, warm kitty…",OTHERS,LEONARD
27632,"I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27633,And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27634,Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?,PENNY,LEONARD
27635,What time did you tell Amy to be here?,SHELDON,LEONARD
27636,"So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.",OTHERS,HOWARD
27637,"We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.",SHELDON,RAJ
27638,"All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.",PENNY,LEONARD
27639,What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27640,Don’t. He’s making our case.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27641,Yes.,RAJ,SHELDON
27642,I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27643,Hiney?,PENNY,LEONARD
27644,"Well, maybe you should tell him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27645,"Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.",RAJ,LEONARD
27646,This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?,LEONARD,LEONARD
27647,"Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.",PENNY,SHELDON
27648,"Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27649,It’s out of order.,PENNY,SHELDON
27650,"Well, great.",LEONARD,OTHERS
27651,I don’t.,PENNY,RAJ
27652,"Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.",RAJ,LEONARD
27653,I’m sorry.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27654,Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27655,"I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27656,"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27657,"Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.",PENNY,LEONARD
27658,"I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go.",LEONARD,PENNY
27659,Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.,PENNY,SHELDON
27660,Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.,PENNY,SHELDON
27661,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
27662,"Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?",HOWARD,SHELDON
27663,"All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27664,"I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27665,"Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.",OTHERS,PENNY
27666,"We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.",RAJ,LEONARD
27667,Hm!,SHELDON,HOWARD
27668,Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?,OTHERS,PENNY
27669,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27670,"Hey, we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?",LEONARD,PENNY
27671,"So, tomorrow?",SHELDON,SHELDON
27672,"You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.",PENNY,OTHERS
27673,I have to make pee-pee.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27674,Thank-you. We’ll be right back.,LEONARD,SHELDON

27676,Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?,SHELDON,OTHERS
27677,The one from whom I live across the hall from.,PENNY,LEONARD
27678,"God, what is going on with you?",OTHERS,PENNY
27679,Dr Gablehauser.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27680,Where’d you get them?,OTHERS,PENNY
27681,"Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.",SHELDON,OTHERS
27682,"Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27683,"Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.",RAJ,RAJ
27684,"Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?",PENNY,LEONARD
27685,Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.,LEONARD,PENNY
27686,Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.,SHELDON,OTHERS
27687,"Okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?",PENNY,LEONARD
27688,"Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27689,"Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.",SHELDON,PENNY
27690,None of that is true.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27691,Yes.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27692,"Also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena.",RAJ,PENNY
27693,"Uh, sounds interesting.",PENNY,SHELDON
27694,"I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!",HOWARD,LEONARD
27695,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27696,"Uh, elephant?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27697,Wait. Wait. And says?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27698,There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.,RAJ,LEONARD
27699,I’m sure he’ll go away.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27700,"Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27701,"Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?",OTHERS,OTHERS
27702,Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.,OTHERS,RAJ
27703,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous.",LEONARD,PENNY
27704,Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27705,I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.,RAJ,LEONARD
27706,"Don’t fall for it. He’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27707,"Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.",PENNY,LEONARD
27708,I remember symposium.,PENNY,HOWARD
27709,"Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.",LEONARD,PENNY
27710,And I can put it in your office?,RAJ,SHELDON
27711,Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27712,"No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in.",PENNY,SHELDON

27714,"And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27715,What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27716,At least my nose is naturally brown.,RAJ,LEONARD
27717,One minute is a long time.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27718,"You know, Sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.",HOWARD,PENNY

27722,"Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27723,Hey.,LEONARD,LEONARD

27725,Explain the couch.,SHELDON,RAJ
27726,"Thank you, Amy.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27727,What is wrong with him?,OTHERS,LEONARD

27730,"Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.",SHELDON,PENNY
27731,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.,LEONARD,PENNY
27732,"Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27733,"Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27734,"No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.",SHELDON,PENNY
27735,"I love you, too.",OTHERS,HOWARD
27736,"I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27737,No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.,SHELDON,PENNY
27738,So. Hot in India?,LEONARD,HOWARD
27739,Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27740,"Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.",RAJ,SHELDON
27741,You’re here a lot now.,SHELDON,HOWARD
27742,Yeah.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27743,"Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27744,But I kind of have a girlfriend.,LEONARD,LEONARD

27746,"Howard, you can’t hold me to that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27747,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?",PENNY,RAJ
27748,"I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.",OTHERS,PENNY
27749,"Oh, man!",HOWARD,PENNY
27750,Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27751,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27752,"I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.",OTHERS,PENNY

27756,"Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD.",SHELDON,PENNY
27757,Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27758,"We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.",SHELDON,PENNY
27759,"Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27760,"If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27761,"Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?",OTHERS,HOWARD
27762,May I say one last thing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27763,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.,RAJ,LEONARD
27764,In the paintball shed! Twice!,HOWARD,LEONARD

27766,"That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?",RAJ,HOWARD

27768,Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!,LEONARD,PENNY
27769,So what’s going on with you two?,LEONARD,LEONARD

27776,"Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27777,Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27778,"Oh, my God, you still go left.",PENNY,LEONARD
27779,Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.,PENNY,SHELDON
27780,I guess he just hates fun.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27781,"Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27782,I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.,SHELDON,HOWARD
27783,Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27784,"Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.",SHELDON,OTHERS
27785,I’ll talk to Leonard.,PENNY,SHELDON
27786,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27787,Ew. Excuse me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
27788,"Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27789,Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?,OTHERS,PENNY
27790,"Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?",HOWARD,HOWARD
27791,He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27792,"Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27793,"Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action.",OTHERS,PENNY
27794,"Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.",HOWARD,PENNY
27795,Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.,PENNY,HOWARD
27796,"So, when are you thinking of moving?",OTHERS,LEONARD
27797,I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
27798,How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home.,HOWARD,HOWARD
27799,"You mean, you want me to keep a secret.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27800,"Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27801,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
27802,"And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?",PENNY,LEONARD
27803,No I didn’t.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27804,"Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27805,"Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.",PENNY,LEONARD
27806,"Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.",RAJ,SHELDON
27807,"Yes, that’s our Lenny.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27808,"Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27809,"Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?",OTHERS,LEONARD
27810,"For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.",OTHERS,PENNY
27811,Thanks again for agreeing to do this.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27812,"Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.",PENNY,SHELDON
27813,What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?,PENNY,LEONARD
27814,Okay.,SHELDON,OTHERS
27815,Yeah.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27816,"Okay, you’re positive you want to know?",HOWARD,OTHERS
27817,What do you think?,LEONARD,RAJ
27818,Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.,HOWARD,PENNY
27819,"I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.",SHELDON,RAJ
27820,"Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.",OTHERS,PENNY
27821,Why not?,LEONARD,RAJ
27822,Have you heard back from Emily?,RAJ,PENNY
27823,chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka.,HOWARD,RAJ
27824,Did you bring the black condoms?,HOWARD,LEONARD
27825,I need a place to crash.,HOWARD,LEONARD
27826,"No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27827,"Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27828,You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?,OTHERS,PENNY
27829,Excellent.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27830,"Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?",SHELDON,PENNY
27831,This sucks.,PENNY,SHELDON
27832,"Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.",PENNY,SHELDON
27833,"Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.",RAJ,SHELDON
27834,"I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared.",SHELDON,PENNY
27835,Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome,SHELDON,RAJ
27836,Excuse me?,PENNY,SHELDON
27837,"Okay, I get it.",HOWARD,PENNY
27838,"Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27839,We’re really sorry. It was an accident.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27840,"Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.",PENNY,SHELDON
27841,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY
27842,"You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?",OTHERS,PENNY
27843,It’s what I do.,SHELDON,LEONARD
27844,"Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work.",PENNY,OTHERS
27845,"Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.",SHELDON,PENNY
27846,"Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.",PENNY,LEONARD
27847,Well count me out.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27848,Fine.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27849,"I’m sorry, what?",PENNY,SHELDON
27850,"So what, I’m unevolved?",OTHERS,LEONARD
27851,"Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts.",PENNY,LEONARD
27852,"Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell.",PENNY,SHELDON
27853,"Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.",PENNY,LEONARD
27854,"No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.",PENNY,PENNY
27855,We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.,RAJ,LEONARD
27856,"What is it, Stuart?",HOWARD,SHELDON
27857,"Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?",OTHERS,OTHERS
27858,"I’ll begin. Uh, I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.",SHELDON,OTHERS
27859,"Zack, this is my friend Claire.",RAJ,LEONARD
27860,"Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?",SHELDON,LEONARD
27861,"Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.",SHELDON,PENNY
27862,"It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.",HOWARD,SHELDON
27863,Thanks pal.,PENNY,HOWARD
27864,"Oh, hey.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27865,"Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.",SHELDON,RAJ
27866,"Really, do tell.",LEONARD,PENNY
27867,That is insane.,LEONARD,PENNY
27868,"Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.",LEONARD,PENNY
27869,What’s the difference?,OTHERS,LEONARD
27870,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27871,"Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27872,"Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.",RAJ,PENNY
27873,Really? Are you sure?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27874,"Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I’m like a flamingo on Ritalin.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27875,"Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?",LEONARD,LEONARD
27876,"Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?",HOWARD,HOWARD
27877,You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27878,It’s been three days. Why hasn’t Stephen Hawking played a word?,SHELDON,HOWARD
27879,"Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?",RAJ,LEONARD
27880,My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27881,That would be great.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27882,"You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27883,"Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27884,"I hear what you’re saying, but I’ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.",RAJ,RAJ
27885,We really shouldn’t be standing here.,PENNY,SHELDON
27886,"Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!",RAJ,SHELDON
27887,"Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27888,"Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27889,But I’m not.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27890,You are a deeply silly man.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27891,"You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27892,No.,SHELDON,PENNY
27893,What’s wrong with you?,RAJ,SHELDON
27894,Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.,OTHERS,RAJ
27895,Oh.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27896,Amy.,RAJ,LEONARD
27897,"No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.",RAJ,LEONARD
27898,"Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.",PENNY,SHELDON
27899,"Bernie, wait!",HOWARD,SHELDON
27900,Sure,LEONARD,PENNY
27901,Who is it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
27902,Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?,RAJ,PENNY
27903,"Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch.",LEONARD,OTHERS
27904,"So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.",RAJ,PENNY
27905,I’m sorry. 16?,SHELDON,SHELDON
27906,"Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27907,"Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27908,"Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.",PENNY,SHELDON
27909,"What are you trying to tell me, Howard?",LEONARD,SHELDON
27910,"If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27911,You’re moving back to India?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27912,It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27913,This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27914,Yeah?,OTHERS,SHELDON
27915,"I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years.",OTHERS,OTHERS
27916,"Fine, I’ll do it.",SHELDON,PENNY
27917,"Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.",SHELDON,PENNY
27918,"Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.",SHELDON,HOWARD
27919,I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.,SHELDON,SHELDON
27920,You poor things you must be exhausted.,PENNY,SHELDON
27921,But yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27922,"Uh-huh. Hang on.  Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27923,Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.,OTHERS,HOWARD
27924,First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.,RAJ,SHELDON
27925,I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27926,"You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.",RAJ,SHELDON
27927,"Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.",PENNY,SHELDON
27928,"No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27929,Hey.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27930,No. I want to do this.,HOWARD,HOWARD
27931,"Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.",RAJ,SHELDON
27932,"And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.",PENNY,SHELDON
27933,"Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?",LEONARD,PENNY
27934,Crossbow.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27935,"Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?",OTHERS,SHELDON
27936,"Okay, like what?",PENNY,HOWARD
27937,"Oh, you silly doodlebug.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27938,"I admire you, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27939,Well.,PENNY,LEONARD
27940,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
27941,No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?,SHELDON,LEONARD
27942,This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.,SHELDON,PENNY
27943,"And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line.",OTHERS,PENNY
27944,"Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?",SHELDON,HOWARD
27945,Don’t make it too hot.,OTHERS,PENNY
27946,"Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?",HOWARD,PENNY
27947,"Oh, well, I’m an actress.",PENNY,LEONARD
27948,It would be a replica of a movie prop.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27949,I have strongly mixed feelings.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27950,"Oh, my God,",OTHERS,SHELDON
27951,"You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.",LEONARD,PENNY
27952,Uh-huh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
27953,"Oh, rose petals.",LEONARD,PENNY
27954,Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?,HOWARD,SHELDON
27955,"Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.",OTHERS,OTHERS
27956,"Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.",OTHERS,RAJ
27957,I’m not going to work.,LEONARD,HOWARD
27958,Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!,HOWARD,LEONARD
27959,"Okay, so what is solder?",PENNY,PENNY
27960,I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.,OTHERS,LEONARD
27961,"I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27962,"Well, Sheldon’s looking for a roommate.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27963,I knew she wasn’t lead car material.,SHELDON,PENNY
27964,"Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do.",PENNY,PENNY
27965,Oh. I’ll be there.,LEONARD,LEONARD
27966,"Oh, no. Where was it parked?",OTHERS,HOWARD
27967,"Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27968,"Well, then why are you going?",PENNY,SHELDON
27969,"Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27970,"Well, there was a lot at stake.",LEONARD,LEONARD
27971,No.,HOWARD,SHELDON
27972,So do it.,HOWARD,PENNY
27973,"Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.",RAJ,LEONARD
27974,"No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27975,"Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27976,"Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.",LEONARD,PENNY
27977,All right. Let’s just finish cooking.,PENNY,SHELDON
27978,"No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.",LEONARD,SHELDON
27979,"Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.",SHELDON,OTHERS
27980,Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.,OTHERS,PENNY
27981,What was the rest of your question?,OTHERS,LEONARD
27982,"Oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her.",SHELDON,LEONARD
27983,"So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?",PENNY,RAJ
27984,"Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors.",OTHERS,SHELDON
27985,"Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.",SHELDON,SHELDON
27986,"Well, why don’t you tell her?",PENNY,SHELDON
27987,"You’re right, this filly’s been broken.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27988,"Hey, Penny.",LEONARD,RAJ
27989,Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?,LEONARD,SHELDON
27990,"So wait,you’re just gonna give up?",LEONARD,PENNY
27991,"I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.",RAJ,SHELDON
27992,Really? Why?,HOWARD,SHELDON
27993,"Yeah, and the bag it came in.",PENNY,LEONARD
27994,I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.,SHELDON,RAJ
27995,No. This is our day.,HOWARD,LEONARD
27996,"You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.",OTHERS,LEONARD
27997,"Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.",HOWARD,LEONARD
27998,"Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!",OTHERS,LEONARD
27999,"Okay, we need to talk.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28000,Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28001,Stop enjoying their fight.,OTHERS,LEONARD
28002,"Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?",LEONARD,SHELDON
28003,"Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it’s none of your business!",PENNY,SHELDON
28004,Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28005,"Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28006,That’d be great. Thank you.,LEONARD,RAJ
28007,I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.,OTHERS,SHELDON
28008,"Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.",RAJ,LEONARD
28009,"I won’t. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28010,"Wow, you popular girls are mean.",PENNY,SHELDON
28011,But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28012,"But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28013,"You know, some people try visualization.",PENNY,LEONARD
28014,"Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28015,"Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!",PENNY,LEONARD
28016,"Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.",HOWARD,LEONARD
28017,"Okay, well, he might like that, I’ve seen him… chilly.",HOWARD,LEONARD
28018,"Oh, and who’s that?",PENNY,RAJ
28019,Really?,LEONARD,HOWARD
28020,Disagree.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28021,"Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON
28022,"Hey, ready for lunch?",LEONARD,SHELDON
28023,"Come on, I’ll help you take this down.",OTHERS,PENNY
28024,It’s only $800?,RAJ,PENNY
28025,Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28026,"Yeah, it’s okay.",PENNY,SHELDON
28027,I know what the anthropic principle is.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28028,Yeah.,SHELDON,LEONARD
28029,"My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?",PENNY,SHELDON
28030,What is your problem?,PENNY,RAJ
28031,Ooh!,OTHERS,SHELDON
28032,"Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28033,"Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.",SHELDON,HOWARD
28034,Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28035,"No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?",SHELDON,LEONARD
28036,Sad.,SHELDON,PENNY
28037,"Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28038,It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!,SHELDON,SHELDON
28039,I don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.,OTHERS,LEONARD
28040,How did you get here in the first place?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28041,I already quit.,PENNY,PENNY
28042,"Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.",PENNY,SHELDON

28315,"Yes, I read you, Sheldon.",HOWARD,HOWARD
28316,"Howard, Howard, look at this.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28317,It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.,HOWARD,LEONARD
28318,"Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28319,Hello.,OTHERS,OTHERS
28320,"Thank you, Penny.",SHELDON,LEONARD
28321,Who’s ready to laugh?,SHELDON,LEONARD
28322,Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.,HOWARD,PENNY
28323,"Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.",RAJ,LEONARD
28324,"Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.",OTHERS,HOWARD
28325,Is that really what’s important right now?,PENNY,OTHERS

28331,You just called dibs.,LEONARD,HOWARD
28332,"Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.",OTHERS,RAJ
28333,It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
28334,"Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.",HOWARD,LEONARD
28335,You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast. Are those soy-based candles?,SHELDON,LEONARD
28336,"I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?",OTHERS,SHELDON
28337,What kinds of things?,SHELDON,SHELDON

28343,You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28344,Is that better?,PENNY,HOWARD
28345,"I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.",SHELDON,RAJ
28346,What’s so funny?,HOWARD,PENNY
28347,Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28348,"Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean.",PENNY,SHELDON
28349,Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28350,It’s bigger than mine.,OTHERS,PENNY
28351,No. We just made out a little.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28352,"Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.",RAJ,SHELDON
28353,"Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.",PENNY,LEONARD
28354,Oh. You could tell it to me.,PENNY,LEONARD
28355,Raj. He really wants to see this movie.,HOWARD,RAJ
28356,"Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28357,"Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?",RAJ,HOWARD
28358,"Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.",PENNY,LEONARD
28359,We could put her stereo back there.,SHELDON,LEONARD
28360,Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?,PENNY,HOWARD
28361,I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her.,HOWARD,RAJ
28362,"Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…",PENNY,SHELDON
28363,"No, it’s about Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28364,We did raise the roof that night.,HOWARD,SHELDON
28365,"God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?",OTHERS,PENNY
28366,"Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?",HOWARD,SHELDON
28367,"It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.",OTHERS,PENNY
28368,"I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.",OTHERS,OTHERS
28369,"Okay, let’s go see your psychic.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28370,Here we go.,OTHERS,SHELDON
28371,That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28372,Because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.,OTHERS,HOWARD
28373,I’m helping.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28374,Sure. Heh.,OTHERS,SHELDON
28375,"Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28376,"Come on, I said I was sorry.",LEONARD,PENNY
28377,"It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.",PENNY,SHELDON
28378,Are you ashamed of me?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28379,"Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?",HOWARD,HOWARD
28380,"I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t go.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28381,Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.,OTHERS,LEONARD
28382,Doesn’t like games. That’s one.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28383,I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.,PENNY,SHELDON
28384,I guess it didn’t go well.,RAJ,LEONARD
28385,Just to help her with her screenplay.,RAJ,SHELDON
28386,I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28387,"Doing what?  All right, you’ve made your point.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28388,I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.,OTHERS,SHELDON
28389,"Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the",PENNY,PENNY
28390,"Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28391,"Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?",PENNY,LEONARD
28392,"No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!",PENNY,HOWARD
28393,"No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides.",SHELDON,LEONARD
28394,"And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28395,Tell me what?,SHELDON,LEONARD
28396,Wrong. Obesity.,SHELDON,OTHERS
28397,There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.,SHELDON,SHELDON

28401,"I don’t know, they’re, chummy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28402,"Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.",HOWARD,PENNY
28403,I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28404,Wow.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28405,That’s fine. I don’t care.,HOWARD,LEONARD
28406,What feelings?,OTHERS,PENNY
28407,Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.,SHELDON,LEONARD
28408,I got the B word.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28409,No.,HOWARD,LEONARD
28410,"They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing.",RAJ,LEONARD
28411,"Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?",PENNY,LEONARD
28412,You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?,HOWARD,SHELDON

28422,"Yeah, you, too.",PENNY,RAJ
28423,I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28424,I have a better idea.,HOWARD,HOWARD
28425,So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?,LEONARD,OTHERS
28426,"Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.",PENNY,LEONARD
28427,No way.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28428,I can’t believe you fit in the crib.,PENNY,LEONARD
28429,"Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.",LEONARD,LEONARD

28433,Too slow?,SHELDON,PENNY
28434,What?,OTHERS,SHELDON
28435,Howard?  Howard?  Howard?,SHELDON,PENNY
28436,"I guess we are. So, what’s going on?",LEONARD,HOWARD
28437,"Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?",SHELDON,PENNY
28438,Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?,OTHERS,SHELDON
28439,Of course not.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28440,"Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.",SHELDON,LEONARD
28441,"No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?",LEONARD,SHELDON
28442,"Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28443,"Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.",SHELDON,SHELDON

28449,Stop!,RAJ,OTHERS
28450,"As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.",OTHERS,LEONARD

28456,"Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.",HOWARD,LEONARD
28457,Thank you.,OTHERS,SHELDON

28461,This is exciting.,RAJ,LEONARD
28462,I don’t want to do this anymore!,OTHERS,SHELDON

28464,Okay. Where were we?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28465,You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.,SHELDON,PENNY
28466,I brought snacks.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28467,That’s fine. She and I can cry together.,RAJ,SHELDON
28468,"Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?",PENNY,HOWARD
28469,"Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?",SHELDON,LEONARD
28470,It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28471,"I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.",LEONARD,PENNY
28472,Won’t.,LEONARD,HOWARD
28473,"Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28474,"All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.",OTHERS,RAJ
28475,"Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28476,"Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.",HOWARD,SHELDON

28481,You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.,LEONARD,OTHERS
28482,Do you have any interest now?,OTHERS,PENNY
28483,"Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28484,"Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?",SHELDON,SHELDON
28485,The one with the little onions? Mmm.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28486,You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.,SHELDON,SHELDON
28487,When can I stab one of my friends?,SHELDON,SHELDON
28488,"This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28489,What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?,SHELDON,PENNY
28490,"You’re welcome, sweetie.",PENNY,LEONARD
28491,"No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.",SHELDON,LEONARD
28492,You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?,HOWARD,LEONARD
28493,Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?,SHELDON,SHELDON
28494,"Okay, uh, how about her?",RAJ,LEONARD
28495,"Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.",RAJ,LEONARD

28508,I miss you as well.,SHELDON,SHELDON

28518,And you don’t think that’s too rough?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28519,I know. I was looking forward to it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28520,"Yeah, still funny, Raj.",HOWARD,RAJ
28521,Why?,SHELDON,OTHERS
28522,Yes. I don’t need an emotion machine. I am one.,SHELDON,LEONARD
28523,"So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?",OTHERS,SHELDON

28552,Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
28553,"Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28554,"Well, then why are you always ripping on me?",HOWARD,HOWARD
28555,What?,LEONARD,RAJ
28556,"Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?",PENNY,OTHERS

28563,"Amy, don’t be like that.",PENNY,LEONARD
28564,Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?,SHELDON,LEONARD

28856,"Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.",RAJ,LEONARD
28857,What’s this?,LEONARD,PENNY
28858,Please show us?,PENNY,LEONARD
28859,"Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you.",PENNY,PENNY
28860,So what happens next?,LEONARD,LEONARD
28861,"Yeah, I wish.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28862,Because I’ve got something even better planned.,RAJ,SHELDON
28863,I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.,PENNY,HOWARD
28864,And when? But also where?,PENNY,HOWARD
28865,People.,PENNY,SHELDON
28866,"Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28867,"What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?",SHELDON,PENNY
28868,"Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.",PENNY,PENNY
28869,I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.,RAJ,LEONARD
28870,"Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28871,Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?,HOWARD,SHELDON
28872,"Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28873,"You know what? If it’s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I’m creepy.",HOWARD,PENNY
28874,"Uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into Sheldon.",RAJ,SHELDON
28875,"Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?",RAJ,HOWARD
28876,Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?,RAJ,HOWARD
28877,You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.,SHELDON,LEONARD
28878,"Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”",SHELDON,SHELDON
28879,"And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.",SHELDON,LEONARD
28880,"All right, then. Good night.",SHELDON,PENNY
28881,"So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?",LEONARD,LEONARD
28882,I’ll friend you on Facebook.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28883,What about the money?,RAJ,LEONARD
28884,I just hope I did the right thing.,OTHERS,PENNY
28885,"That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28886,"No, thanks. I’m fine.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28887,Why not?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28888,"Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I disappointed you.",OTHERS,PENNY
28889,Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.,OTHERS,SHELDON
28890,"You know, if it makes you feel any better…",PENNY,SHELDON
28891,"This one’s a player, huh?",OTHERS,LEONARD
28892,What’s the matter?,PENNY,SHELDON
28893,"I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.",HOWARD,PENNY
28894,"Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.",HOWARD,LEONARD
28895,"Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.",OTHERS,PENNY
28896,Fine. I’ll have a virgin cuba libre.,SHELDON,OTHERS
28897,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?",PENNY,PENNY
28898,"No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28899,"It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?",SHELDON,OTHERS
28900,Congratulations.,HOWARD,PENNY
28901,"I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28902,"Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you are.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28903,"Of course you’re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28904,"Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?",SHELDON,RAJ
28905,Fine.,SHELDON,PENNY
28906,So aren’t you going to go talk to her?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28907,"No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28908,"Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?",SHELDON,SHELDON
28909,Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.,RAJ,OTHERS
28910,"Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.",PENNY,SHELDON
28911,You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.,RAJ,PENNY
28912,"Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  I’ll get it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28913,That was two hours ago.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28914,She seems nice. Who’s she?,OTHERS,SHELDON
28915,It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.,OTHERS,SHELDON
28916,"Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28917,"This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.",PENNY,LEONARD
28918,I had half a glass.,OTHERS,LEONARD
28919,"Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I’ll blow it. Better?",OTHERS,OTHERS
28920,"Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.",PENNY,PENNY
28921,Oh.,PENNY,RAJ
28922,Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.,OTHERS,RAJ
28923,Little higher on the right.,OTHERS,PENNY
28924,"Oh, I thought you said he was okay.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28925,"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?",OTHERS,RAJ
28926,"Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?",HOWARD,LEONARD
28927,Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?,HOWARD,SHELDON
28928,"Oh, that’s too bad.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28929,"Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?",OTHERS,SHELDON
28930,"Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.",PENNY,LEONARD
28931,"Yeah, sure, whatever.",HOWARD,OTHERS
28932,I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.,LEONARD,LEONARD
28933,"Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy.  Hello?",RAJ,HOWARD
28934,I’m making a bracelet.,OTHERS,LEONARD
28935,"Oh really? Well, good for him.",PENNY,SHELDON
28936,And you want me to kill her? Done.,OTHERS,HOWARD
28937,"She says, do you play an instrument?",HOWARD,PENNY
28938,Just sit.,PENNY,SHELDON
28939,"And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.",PENNY,LEONARD
28940,How?,PENNY,LEONARD
28941,"Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…",LEONARD,SHELDON
28942,"We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
28943,"No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28944,"Well, how did you know about it?",LEONARD,SHELDON
28945,"Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.",SHELDON,HOWARD
28946,"I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.",SHELDON,PENNY
28947,"I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.",RAJ,PENNY
28948,"Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28949,Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.,SHELDON,PENNY
28950,"Oh, hi. Hi.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28951,I think I know.,PENNY,HOWARD
28952,I honestly don’t care.,LEONARD,HOWARD
28953,Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28954,He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.,RAJ,LEONARD
28955,"Sheldon, I’m so sorry.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28956,Wait a minute. You hate dogs.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28957,"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.",PENNY,SHELDON
28958,"I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.",LEONARD,LEONARD
28959,"It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28960,"Hey, that guy’s looking over here.",PENNY,LEONARD
28961,Want me to show my work?,SHELDON,PENNY
28962,"I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.",RAJ,OTHERS
28963,"Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of excited to see Sheldon.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28964,What are you doing?,PENNY,LEONARD
28965,Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?,LEONARD,SHELDON
28966,Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!,SHELDON,SHELDON
28967,"Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?",PENNY,SHELDON
28968,Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.,PENNY,PENNY
28969,"You’re a real hero, Howard.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28970,"I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28971,Oh. What happened with that?,OTHERS,SHELDON
28972,"Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.",RAJ,LEONARD
28973,We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.,PENNY,SHELDON
28974,"Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.",HOWARD,SHELDON
28975,My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.,HOWARD,SHELDON
28976,"Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.",OTHERS,PENNY
28977,"Okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?",PENNY,OTHERS
28978,"I can keep this, right?",HOWARD,LEONARD
28979,It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.,LEONARD,PENNY
28980,"All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!",SHELDON,RAJ
28981,"Oh, my God.",OTHERS,OTHERS
28982,You walk away.,HOWARD,PENNY
28983,"Where are you going with this, Leonard?",OTHERS,SHELDON
28984,"Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs.",PENNY,LEONARD
28985,"He’s living at my place, so I’m living here.",RAJ,SHELDON
28986,Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.,PENNY,LEONARD
28987,"If you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?",HOWARD,LEONARD
28988,"Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.",OTHERS,SHELDON
28989,What are you doing?,SHELDON,OTHERS
28990,Let me guess.,SHELDON,HOWARD
28991,"Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.",LEONARD,HOWARD
28992,"It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.",OTHERS,LEONARD
28993,Oh hey.,PENNY,OTHERS
28994,It was us. We knocked over a lamp.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28995,Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?,PENNY,SHELDON
28996,"Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.",HOWARD,PENNY
28997,I just thought of one more.,LEONARD,SHELDON
28998,"Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway.",SHELDON,SHELDON
28999,Because she’s great in everything.,RAJ,LEONARD
29000,"Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29001,Yeah.,PENNY,LEONARD
29002,"Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29003,Why are you on a diet?,RAJ,HOWARD
29004,"Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29005,"Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.",OTHERS,HOWARD
29006,"Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29007,"Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.",PENNY,SHELDON
29008,Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?,SHELDON,RAJ
29009,Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Don’t do that!,RAJ,PENNY
29010,"For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous.",SHELDON,RAJ
29011,"Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29012,"No throwing, no catching, no running.",SHELDON,PENNY
29013,Okay. Have fun.,PENNY,SHELDON
29014,"Good, good. Everything okay between you two?",LEONARD,LEONARD
29015,"All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.",PENNY,LEONARD
29016,"Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!",PENNY,SHELDON
29017,"For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.",PENNY,PENNY
29018,Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have.,HOWARD,PENNY
29019,"Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?",PENNY,SHELDON
29020,"Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?",RAJ,SHELDON
29021,How did you get into my apartment?,OTHERS,LEONARD
29022,I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29023,"What?! No, he doesn’t.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29024,"You’re kidding. You’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick.",HOWARD,OTHERS
29025,I suppose I could if I were asked.,SHELDON,HOWARD
29026,Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?,PENNY,SHELDON
29027,Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29028,I can’t believe he set it on fire.,OTHERS,HOWARD
29029,"Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.",PENNY,OTHERS
29030,"Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?",RAJ,LEONARD
29031,"No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.",SHELDON,PENNY
29032,"You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.",SHELDON,OTHERS
29033,"Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.",RAJ,RAJ
29034,"Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…",OTHERS,HOWARD
29035,Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?,OTHERS,PENNY
29036,No.,LEONARD,OTHERS
29037,"You’re welcome, ladies.",RAJ,SHELDON
29038,"Thanks. You, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29039,I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.,PENNY,SHELDON
29040,"Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.",SHELDON,HOWARD
29041,"Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.",SHELDON,HOWARD
29042,This is a very old building.,SHELDON,PENNY
29043,"Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography.",RAJ,LEONARD
29044,"Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29045,"Yes, you are.",RAJ,SHELDON
29046,"Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.",HOWARD,PENNY
29047,I assure you I do.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29048,"Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29049,"I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29050,Are you attracted to him?,OTHERS,SHELDON
29051,"Well, guess I gotta drink.",PENNY,SHELDON
29052,"No, but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29053,"I don’t know, you pretty much covered it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29054,"That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?",LEONARD,RAJ
29055,"So, that’s it? We’re not going?",PENNY,PENNY
29056,"You know, I haven’t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29057,"Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29058,Definitely.,PENNY,LEONARD
29059,All right.,PENNY,PENNY
29060,This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…,SHELDON,HOWARD
29061,"Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?",OTHERS,SHELDON
29062,I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.,PENNY,SHELDON
29063,Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.,RAJ,SHELDON
29064,"Well, it was going to be mine.",OTHERS,RAJ
29065,Holy smokes.,PENNY,SHELDON
29066,"Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29067,Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?,SHELDON,RAJ
29068,You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?,SHELDON,LEONARD
29069,"Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29070,Hoo.,OTHERS,OTHERS
29071,"Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.",PENNY,HOWARD
29072,"So now you think you’re better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women don’t like you.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29073,Hi!,RAJ,SHELDON
29074,Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.,SHELDON,PENNY
29075,"Thank you, Dr. Cooper.",OTHERS,PENNY
29076,I don’t drive.,SHELDON,HOWARD
29077,I’m sorry. I don’t recall you saying no backsies.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29078,"I no longer care, dear. But don’t worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29079,How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29080,"Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with me.",PENNY,PENNY
29081,Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?,SHELDON,SHELDON
29082,I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.,PENNY,LEONARD
29083,That was painful to watch.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29084,One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?,OTHERS,PENNY
29085,"Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.",SHELDON,PENNY
29086,"Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29087,I don’t believe it.,RAJ,LEONARD
29088,"My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations.",SHELDON,RAJ
29089,"Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.",SHELDON,RAJ
29090,"Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.",RAJ,PENNY
29091,"You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.",RAJ,SHELDON
29092,Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?,PENNY,RAJ
29093,Have you ever seen them?,LEONARD,HOWARD
29094,"Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.",LEONARD,OTHERS
29095,Morning.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29096,Sheldon.  What’s going on?,LEONARD,PENNY
29097,"Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together.",PENNY,LEONARD
29098,"I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.",RAJ,HOWARD
29099,I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.,SHELDON,HOWARD
29100,Sheldon.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29101,Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.,LEONARD,PENNY
29102,"I, I knew the answer. I got excited.",PENNY,LEONARD
29103,Social anxiety.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29104,"Oh, Amelia.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29105,"You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29106,"What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular.",PENNY,SHELDON
29107,"Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29108,Bernadette?,SHELDON,LEONARD
29109,"I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard.",PENNY,SHELDON
29110,Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29111,You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29112,"Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29113,You have to get rid of the chair.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29114,I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.,LEONARD,RAJ

29125,"Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29126,Thank you again for dinner.,SHELDON,PENNY
29127,"Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks.",OTHERS,RAJ
29128,"Again, I’ve never given it much thought.",PENNY,LEONARD
29129,"You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29130,I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29131,"Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.",SHELDON,PENNY
29132,Just a toy robot?,SHELDON,PENNY
29133,"Wait, what is going on?",HOWARD,LEONARD
29134,"No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.",SHELDON,RAJ
29135,"Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.",PENNY,SHELDON
29136,Name one.,RAJ,LEONARD
29137,Hey. Thanks for coming by.,RAJ,SHELDON
29138,"A moment ago, when you turned off the TV during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?",SHELDON,SHELDON
29139,"So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.",HOWARD,PENNY
29140,Can I sit in your spot?,LEONARD,LEONARD
29141,"Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.",LEONARD,RAJ
29142,What’s this?,RAJ,PENNY
29143,But he’s sad.,PENNY,PENNY
29144,"That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?",PENNY,SHELDON
29145,Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29146,You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.,HOWARD,LEONARD
29147,"Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself.",HOWARD,OTHERS
29148,"Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29149,"Oh, come on.",RAJ,OTHERS
29150,"Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29151,"Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29152,"I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?",SHELDON,PENNY
29153,"Okay, that I believe.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29154,"Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29155,"On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29156,Your handwriting is impeccable.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29157,"Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can’t see without my glasses. And right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29158,"Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?",PENNY,PENNY
29159,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
29160,So she’s available for coitus?,HOWARD,LEONARD
29161,"You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.",LEONARD,HOWARD
29162,I had extra dough.,OTHERS,RAJ
29163,Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29164,"I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.",HOWARD,SHELDON

29169,Howdy.,HOWARD,SHELDON

29173,"Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29174,No.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29175,It’s okay.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29176,"Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29177,"It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.",SHELDON,PENNY
29178,Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29179,Feel better now?,RAJ,SHELDON
29180,"Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either.",LEONARD,HOWARD
29181,Seems a shame to throw it away.,LEONARD,LEONARD
29182,"Oh, you shouldn’t have.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29183,Not even when you were a kid?,PENNY,LEONARD
29184,"Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?",HOWARD,PENNY
29185,"Oh, hi.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29186,"No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29187,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29188,Then why are you telling me?,LEONARD,HOWARD
29189,What?,OTHERS,SHELDON
29190,Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?,HOWARD,SHELDON
29191,I could eat.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29192,"Okay, can you just let me in.",PENNY,OTHERS
29193,Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29194,So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?,LEONARD,SHELDON
29195,Terrific.,RAJ,SHELDON
29196,Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.,RAJ,PENNY
29197,Really?,SHELDON,SHELDON
29198,Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29199,You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?,HOWARD,SHELDON
29200,"I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29201,"I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.",RAJ,SHELDON
29202,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.,RAJ,LEONARD
29203,"So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?",LEONARD,PENNY
29204,It’s okay if you say no.,PENNY,LEONARD
29205,We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29206,"There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.",LEONARD,PENNY
29207,The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.,HOWARD,RAJ
29208,I hate my job.,PENNY,HOWARD
29209,"Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.",LEONARD,RAJ
29210,There’s no shame in asking for a break.,PENNY,HOWARD
29211,You got it.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29212,"Well, is there anything I could do to help?",OTHERS,LEONARD
29213,Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?,OTHERS,OTHERS

29217,We’re going to be hundred-aires.,HOWARD,PENNY
29218,What are you doing?,HOWARD,OTHERS
29219,"Not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…",SHELDON,LEONARD
29220,Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29221,Oh. How are you?,OTHERS,LEONARD
29222,You sure?,RAJ,HOWARD
29223,"I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29224,So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29225,"We did, you never brought it.",OTHERS,HOWARD
29226,"No, I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee.",SHELDON,HOWARD
29227,"All right, here goes nothing.",LEONARD,PENNY
29228,"Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?",LEONARD,OTHERS
29229,I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29230,"Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.",PENNY,SHELDON
29231,Boy teenagers.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29232,Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.,PENNY,RAJ
29233,Oh. Very clever. But still racist.,RAJ,PENNY
29234,"Okay, uh, I’m gonna own you, bitch.",RAJ,HOWARD
29235,"Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?",PENNY,LEONARD

29237,That’s my girl.,LEONARD,LEONARD
29238,"Oh, good. I passed the barriers.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29239,It’s on like Alderaan.,RAJ,HOWARD
29240,"I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.",SHELDON,HOWARD
29241,You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29242,"I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29243,I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29244,Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.,HOWARD,PENNY
29245,"Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29246,"And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”",HOWARD,PENNY
29247,Give me that. Just stop showing me up.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29248,"Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?",SHELDON,LEONARD
29249,What do we do now?,RAJ,PENNY
29250,"Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.",PENNY,SHELDON
29251,Like the Black Death and Europe.,HOWARD,LEONARD
29252,"Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.",HOWARD,PENNY
29253,"Okay, but earlier it seemed like…",LEONARD,OTHERS
29254,"So, not a puppy?",HOWARD,SHELDON
29255,"I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.",RAJ,HOWARD
29256,What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?,OTHERS,SHELDON
29257,And control it how?,LEONARD,LEONARD
29258,"Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.",RAJ,LEONARD
29259,Why? What happened?,LEONARD,LEONARD
29260,Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29261,"How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29262,"No, that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back, Jack.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29263,"Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.",SHELDON,PENNY
29264,I don’t understand the question.,SHELDON,SHELDON

29266,Professor Hawking.,SHELDON,RAJ
29267,I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.,SHELDON,HOWARD

29269,"Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29270,Ready for dinner?,HOWARD,SHELDON

29272,"Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know.",PENNY,LEONARD
29273,"You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.",RAJ,OTHERS
29274,"Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.",LEONARD,RAJ
29275,"Well, no offence, but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.",RAJ,SHELDON
29276,What did you do?,SHELDON,PENNY
29277,"I’m sorry, don’t listen to him. We’re actually physicists. We’re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.",LEONARD,HOWARD
29278,"Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29279,I found the decaf!,PENNY,LEONARD

29282,I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.,PENNY,OTHERS
29283,And you moved in anyway?,PENNY,LEONARD

29286,I miss this.,OTHERS,PENNY

29288,I wasn’t going to tell you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29289,"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29290,"Oh, will you please let it go?",PENNY,PENNY
29291,Yes.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29292,Then swim to Cuba.,PENNY,LEONARD
29293,I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.,LEONARD,HOWARD
29294,Penny?,OTHERS,HOWARD
29295,"Well, I mean, I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.",LEONARD,HOWARD
29296,Are you done?,PENNY,PENNY
29297,Should we stop holding hands now?,HOWARD,LEONARD
29298,"There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.",SHELDON,HOWARD
29299,You have a sarcasm sign?,SHELDON,SHELDON

29308,"I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.",PENNY,HOWARD
29309,"What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29310,We had a really nice swim.,PENNY,SHELDON

29319,"Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29320,"No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29321,"Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?",HOWARD,SHELDON
29322,"Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29323,"Guys, help me.",RAJ,PENNY
29324,"Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there.",LEONARD,RAJ
29325,"I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.",RAJ,LEONARD
29326,I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.,SHELDON,PENNY
29327,"No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29328,"Oh, hi.",LEONARD,HOWARD

29336,Good guess.,HOWARD,HOWARD
29337,"It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON

29340,"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?",PENNY,LEONARD

29358,"How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29359,"Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.",LEONARD,PENNY
29360,"It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29361,"Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.",HOWARD,SHELDON

29375,"She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.",RAJ,PENNY
29376,"Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29377,"Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.",RAJ,SHELDON
29378,"I know, I know.",PENNY,SHELDON
29379,No. I’m having a moral crisis.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29380,"All right, people, let’s get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body’s in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29381,"I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29382,Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.,RAJ,LEONARD
29383,"Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.",HOWARD,HOWARD
29384,"Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29385,"Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29386,"Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team.",OTHERS,PENNY
29387,I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.,OTHERS,HOWARD
29388,Labradoodle?,HOWARD,LEONARD
29389,That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29390,Au contraire.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29391,You own a smoking monkey?,SHELDON,LEONARD
29392,Have you been running?,PENNY,SHELDON
29393,"Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great.",OTHERS,OTHERS
29394,"Howard, listen…",LEONARD,SHELDON
29395,"Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.",SHELDON,RAJ
29396,Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29397,Ouch.,PENNY,LEONARD
29398,"I mean, who even reads Scientific American?",PENNY,SHELDON
29399,Great. And?,RAJ,PENNY
29400,"Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?",PENNY,LEONARD
29401,"Sheldon, that’s enough.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29402,You know it’s meant as a compliment.,HOWARD,LEONARD
29403,It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.,LEONARD,PENNY
29404,Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29405,"No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29406,"If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29407,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.",PENNY,SHELDON
29408,"No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29409,"I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29410,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29411,"Oh, I don’t think there will be.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29412,"Oh, is that offer for everybody?",PENNY,SHELDON
29413,You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29414,This package came while you were at work.,SHELDON,HOWARD
29415,It’s my office.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29416,What happened?,OTHERS,HOWARD
29417,"Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.",PENNY,LEONARD
29418,No. You?,OTHERS,HOWARD
29419,"You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.",SHELDON,PENNY
29420,"Yes, it’s not the same without him.",RAJ,SHELDON
29421,Did it have six breasts?,OTHERS,LEONARD
29422,"Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.",LEONARD,PENNY
29423,"Oh, me, too.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29424,Eureka!,HOWARD,SHELDON
29425,"Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad.",OTHERS,HOWARD
29426,"It’s okay, I’m fine.",RAJ,LEONARD
29427,"You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.",LEONARD,OTHERS
29428,"I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.",SHELDON,HOWARD

29430,No. Damage is done.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29431,"I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.",RAJ,LEONARD
29432,"Well, what if you get it?",LEONARD,SHELDON
29433,"I’m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.",SHELDON,RAJ
29434,"Oh, what’s that ring box?",PENNY,SHELDON
29435,You should see the Valentine’s Day card he gave me.,OTHERS,HOWARD
29436,"I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.",OTHERS,PENNY
29437,Are you drunk?,LEONARD,LEONARD
29438,You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.,HOWARD,LEONARD
29439,"Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.",RAJ,SHELDON
29440,"While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.",RAJ,SHELDON
29441,"No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29442,Thank God for Plan B.,HOWARD,LEONARD
29443,Why would you knock over a lamp?,SHELDON,PENNY
29444,You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29445,This is the part where you talk.,RAJ,HOWARD
29446,"All right, I will.",RAJ,LEONARD
29447,And he’s back in the closet.,PENNY,OTHERS
29448,"Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes.",PENNY,LEONARD
29449,"Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?",LEONARD,SHELDON
29450,"Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.",OTHERS,OTHERS
29451,It’s not your fault.,LEONARD,RAJ
29452,"Leonard, I don’t think I can do this.",SHELDON,LEONARD
29453,"Uh, oh, sorry.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29454,"Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?",OTHERS,SHELDON
29455,Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.,HOWARD,SHELDON
29456,"Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night.",OTHERS,OTHERS
29457,"Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work.",RAJ,HOWARD
29458,"Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back.",HOWARD,RAJ
29459,"Hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?",RAJ,LEONARD
29460,How can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.,HOWARD,HOWARD
29461,"It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.",RAJ,SHELDON
29462,Zack.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29463,"Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29464,"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?",SHELDON,PENNY
29465,I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.,SHELDON,OTHERS
29466,"Amy, we’re really sorry.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29467,I think he misses his little buddy.,PENNY,SHELDON
29468,"Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala.",HOWARD,PENNY
29469,"Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.",PENNY,PENNY
29470,"Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.",RAJ,LEONARD
29471,Sorry.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29472,"How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?",LEONARD,SHELDON
29473,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?,SHELDON,OTHERS
29474,Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.,PENNY,LEONARD
29475,"All right.  Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29476,"No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I’m just feeling like something’s bothering you.",HOWARD,HOWARD

29478,"Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.",PENNY,LEONARD
29479,Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29480,Yes.,LEONARD,LEONARD
29481,Excuse me.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29482,"He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
29483,We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?,PENNY,LEONARD
29484,Yes.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29485,"Uh, thank you for the drink.",RAJ,SHELDON
29486,"Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29487,You mean like fatties and uggos?,RAJ,LEONARD
29488,"Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.",RAJ,SHELDON
29489,"I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.  Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear.",HOWARD,LEONARD
29490,Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29491,"Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?",OTHERS,HOWARD
29492,"Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?",RAJ,PENNY
29493,"No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29494,Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.,LEONARD,SHELDON
29495,Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.,OTHERS,SHELDON
29496,This movie baffles me every time we watch it.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29497,"Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.",PENNY,SHELDON
29498,Maybe.,HOWARD,LEONARD
29499,"Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29500,"You did this, didn’t you?",SHELDON,LEONARD

29504,Oh.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29505,"Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29506,"Yes, you can.",LEONARD,LEONARD

29509,Where are we going?,SHELDON,SHELDON
29510,Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.,LEONARD,PENNY
29511,Got it.,PENNY,HOWARD
29512,"Well, excuse me, I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”",RAJ,LEONARD
29513,Wait. It’s here.,RAJ,SHELDON
29514,"Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut.",OTHERS,PENNY

29516,"Wow, you got a lot of money in there.",PENNY,SHELDON
29517,"Okay, well, make yourself at home.",LEONARD,LEONARD
29518,"Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.",PENNY,SHELDON
29519,Howard?,SHELDON,PENNY
29520,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?,SHELDON,SHELDON
29521,"You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year, too.",LEONARD,HOWARD
29522,"Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.",RAJ,SHELDON
29523,Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.,SHELDON,LEONARD
29524,Not really.,OTHERS,LEONARD
29525,"Ooh, yes. Fun.",PENNY,LEONARD
29526,Why?,HOWARD,SHELDON
29527,How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.,SHELDON,SHELDON
29528,Well you can’t just call dibs.,HOWARD,PENNY
29529,Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.,LEONARD,LEONARD
29530,Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?,SHELDON,LEONARD
29531,"I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.",LEONARD,SHELDON

29534,"Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29535,"You know, Amy, I, uh, can’t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.",OTHERS,LEONARD
29536,Really? He said that?,HOWARD,SHELDON
29537,"Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.",OTHERS,SHELDON
29538,What good is it if you don’t use it?,PENNY,LEONARD
29539,"Oh, what’s the point of everything?",RAJ,SHELDON
29540,Is that really the reason?,OTHERS,PENNY
29541,I’ll take a look at it.,LEONARD,PENNY
29542,Got it.,PENNY,SHELDON
29543,"On our Quidditch team, he…",LEONARD,LEONARD
29544,"What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?",HOWARD,PENNY
29545,"No, just try.",PENNY,SHELDON
29546,"Hey, you know what we should do?",LEONARD,SHELDON
29547,I didn’t understand your e-mail.,OTHERS,HOWARD

29552,Just as challenging?,PENNY,PENNY
29553,"Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.",SHELDON,SHELDON
29554,You mean a moo-stache?,RAJ,SHELDON
29555,"By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.",RAJ,SHELDON
29556,"So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?",PENNY,SHELDON
29557,That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.,SHELDON,SHELDON

29568,"Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.",HOWARD,SHELDON
29569,"No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?",SHELDON,OTHERS

29571,You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.,LEONARD,LEONARD

29592,"Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.",LEONARD,SHELDON
29593,This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?,OTHERS,PENNY
29594,"Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.",PENNY,LEONARD

30170,"Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30171,Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.,RAJ,HOWARD
30172,"What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30173,In the 1800s that was considered flirting.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30174,What?,HOWARD,LEONARD
30175,Is it too late for him to cancel?,RAJ,LEONARD
30176,I’d hit that.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30177,"Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
30178,I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30179,"Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?",PENNY,HOWARD
30180,"Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.",PENNY,LEONARD
30181,Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?,SHELDON,SHELDON
30182,"Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30183,"You’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, I’ve made my choice.",RAJ,SHELDON
30184,Please.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30185,Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.,SHELDON,LEONARD
30186,"First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30187,You sent your brother cigarettes?,OTHERS,HOWARD
30188,"Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.",PENNY,SHELDON
30189,"Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30190,"Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?",LEONARD,LEONARD
30191,That’s never been proven.,OTHERS,HOWARD
30192,Hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
30193,"Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30194,"Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites.",PENNY,PENNY
30195,"Me, either.",PENNY,LEONARD
30196,"But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…",RAJ,PENNY
30197,Is that racist? It feels racist.,RAJ,LEONARD
30198,"No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30199,I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.,RAJ,SHELDON
30200,"Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?",SHELDON,LEONARD
30201,"They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30202,"Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30203,"Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?",OTHERS,HOWARD
30204,"Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.",RAJ,RAJ
30205,Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?,SHELDON,HOWARD
30206,It’s midnight. Happy birthday.,SHELDON,PENNY
30207,"That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30208,"Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30209,What makes you think I can convince her?,LEONARD,PENNY
30210,"What’d you do, delete your photo?",SHELDON,RAJ
30211,More.,HOWARD,LEONARD
30212,Really?,HOWARD,SHELDON
30213,"You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?",LEONARD,SHELDON
30214,Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?,SHELDON,SHELDON
30215,"Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30216,"The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food.",RAJ,HOWARD
30217,"Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30218,Then you left me no choice.,HOWARD,RAJ
30219,"Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30220,"Okay. Well, I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!",PENNY,SHELDON
30221,Yep. Shake that thing.,PENNY,PENNY
30222,"No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.",RAJ,SHELDON
30223,"Oh, my God. What happened?",LEONARD,LEONARD
30224,"That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?",PENNY,SHELDON
30225,Are you serious? For what?,PENNY,SHELDON
30226,"That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30227,"Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.",LEONARD,OTHERS
30228,His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?,LEONARD,SHELDON
30229,"You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.",PENNY,LEONARD
30230,He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30231,"What do you say, Howard?",RAJ,LEONARD
30232,"This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30233,"Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30234,"Okay, let’s get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don’t need to be getting this old world crap from you.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30235,"Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?",PENNY,SHELDON
30236,"You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30237,"You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?",SHELDON,PENNY
30238,Never mind.,PENNY,LEONARD
30239,"That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.",HOWARD,HOWARD
30240,It’s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That’s his food diary.,OTHERS,LEONARD
30241,And I told you he bit me.,RAJ,SHELDON
30242,Will our hotel room be ready?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30243,Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?,OTHERS,HOWARD
30244,"Thanks, mom. Mom?",SHELDON,SHELDON
30245,This is how the Flash paces.,SHELDON,RAJ
30246,You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.,SHELDON,HOWARD
30247,What the hell is that.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30248,No. I was just tricking you.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30249,Oh. Pass.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30250,That’s the part you have a problem with?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30251,Try again.,OTHERS,PENNY
30252,I told you she exists.,RAJ,SHELDON
30253,"Oh, good, you’re finally home.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30254,"This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30255,"Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.",PENNY,SHELDON
30256,"Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.",PENNY,LEONARD
30257,Where are you going?,OTHERS,SHELDON
30258,We’re not home right now.,SHELDON,LEONARD
30259,"Yep, I don’t see any way around it.",RAJ,SHELDON
30260,Aw. What’s wrong with her?,LEONARD,SHELDON
30261,Oh.,HOWARD,RAJ
30262,"Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.",RAJ,OTHERS
30263,I don’t think this is gonna work.,LEONARD,PENNY
30264,Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.,LEONARD,HOWARD
30265,Yeah.,OTHERS,LEONARD
30266,"Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.",RAJ,LEONARD
30267,"Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30268,"What, what are you doing in our apartment?",PENNY,LEONARD
30269,"Leonard, are you okay.",PENNY,HOWARD
30270,I use them. I don’t like them.,OTHERS,LEONARD
30271,"Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30272,"Third floor, wrong apartment.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30273,"Yeah, really sorry.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30274,"Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30275,"Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”",HOWARD,LEONARD
30276,"Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30277,Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30278,"No,  You were saying, but…",LEONARD,PENNY
30279,"Mm, indeed.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30280,"I did say that, didn’t I?",OTHERS,LEONARD
30281,"Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.",OTHERS,PENNY
30282,"No, we just want information.",PENNY,RAJ
30283,"Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30284,I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.,SHELDON,LEONARD
30285,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
30286,"That’s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!",OTHERS,SHELDON
30287,"Yeah, it’s a bitch.",PENNY,HOWARD
30288,Why don’t you just break up with her?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30289,"Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30290,"She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you",RAJ,SHELDON
30291,"Well, you’re losing your son.",PENNY,SHELDON
30292,"It’s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.",OTHERS,OTHERS
30293,"A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!",SHELDON,LEONARD
30294,It unhooks in the front.,OTHERS,HOWARD
30295,"Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.",PENNY,PENNY
30296,"Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30297,"No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30298,There was.,RAJ,HOWARD
30299,Seven.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30300,That’s the toilet?,SHELDON,SHELDON
30301,"I love you, too.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30302,"That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30303,"Okay, good example.",PENNY,SHELDON
30304,I think that reason’s called racism.,OTHERS,PENNY
30305,"Okay, well, thank you, again.",PENNY,HOWARD
30306,What can it hurt?,OTHERS,HOWARD
30307,"Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?",PENNY,SHELDON
30308,No.,PENNY,SHELDON
30309,Really?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30310,That’s not what it is.,LEONARD,PENNY
30311,"Oh, good.",LEONARD,LEONARD

30313,"Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.",PENNY,SHELDON
30314,How come he can say it and I can’t?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30315,"We’re talking about the same Leonard, right?",OTHERS,SHELDON
30316,Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.,SHELDON,LEONARD
30317,Really?,HOWARD,SHELDON
30318,"All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30319,"Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn’t know you played the cello?",PENNY,SHELDON
30320,"Oh, God.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30321,No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?,PENNY,LEONARD
30322,"Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?",PENNY,SHELDON
30323,Don’t you be disrespectful to her.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30324,What is this?,PENNY,LEONARD
30325,"No, look.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30326,"In general, yes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30327,"Hi, honey.",OTHERS,SHELDON

30329,"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?",SHELDON,HOWARD
30330,"Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.",LEONARD,PENNY
30331,Morning.,SHELDON,HOWARD

30338,"I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going.",LEONARD,HOWARD
30339,So where do you sleep?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30340,I saw that.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30341,"I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?",PENNY,LEONARD
30342,Nice.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30343,You have an engagement ring?,OTHERS,PENNY
30344,I’m really going to miss you.,HOWARD,HOWARD
30345,He said we could call him Stan.,HOWARD,OTHERS
30346,"No, I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30347,"Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.",RAJ,SHELDON
30348,"Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.",HOWARD,LEONARD

30353,"Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone.",PENNY,SHELDON
30354,"No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!",SHELDON,SHELDON
30355,"Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?",PENNY,LEONARD
30356,"It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30357,"This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?",HOWARD,SHELDON
30358,"Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30359,You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.,HOWARD,LEONARD

30361,"Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30362,"Sheldon, may I ask you a question?",PENNY,LEONARD
30363,"Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30364,"Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.",PENNY,LEONARD
30365,"Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30366,What’s the matter?,HOWARD,HOWARD

30369,"And finally, my moo shu pork.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30370,Right again.,LEONARD,LEONARD
30371,Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.,SHELDON,OTHERS
30372,Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.,SHELDON,PENNY

30379,"Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.",HOWARD,HOWARD
30380,"I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.",LEONARD,OTHERS

30452,You’re having people over?,LEONARD,LEONARD

30483,Good one. And an electrical charge.,SHELDON,HOWARD
30484,"Sheldon, what did you do?",OTHERS,SHELDON

30486,"Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her.",HOWARD,SHELDON

30501,"That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30502,"You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30503,Or as I know him?,PENNY,SHELDON
30504,My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.,OTHERS,LEONARD

30516,And then some. I think we had a moment.,RAJ,LEONARD
30517,But you can pal around with a hagfish?,OTHERS,LEONARD

30520,"Okay, well, you feel better.",PENNY,LEONARD
30521,"You can think about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can’t order the corresponding dish in column B. That’s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30522,"Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30523,"He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death.",SHELDON,PENNY
30524,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.,LEONARD,PENNY

30536,You narcissistic nincompoop!,HOWARD,SHELDON
30537,Ah.,HOWARD,PENNY

30539,"Oh, I love you so much.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30540,"Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.",SHELDON,HOWARD

30554,What was I supposed to say.,LEONARD,LEONARD
30555,Which is?,RAJ,LEONARD

30718,"Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.",SHELDON,PENNY
30719,I can’t feel my legs.,OTHERS,OTHERS

30721,You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?,PENNY,PENNY
30722,You sure?,RAJ,SHELDON
30723,"Well, I get why he’s annoyed.",OTHERS,PENNY
30724,"Oh, thank God, you’re here.",HOWARD,PENNY
30725,Beats me. They were playing all last night too.,LEONARD,LEONARD
30726,Juggle.,HOWARD,PENNY
30727,"Leonard, I’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30728,But I just broke up with my girlfriend.,RAJ,SHELDON
30729,I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30730,"Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30731,"Hey, isn’t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30732,Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30733,"The ladies are away, the boys will play.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30734,Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”,OTHERS,SHELDON
30735,"Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30736,"Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?",LEONARD,LEONARD
30737,"Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30738,No.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30739,Hey.,PENNY,SHELDON
30740,I’m sorry.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30741,Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.,OTHERS,RAJ
30742,When did you get an engagement ring?,OTHERS,HOWARD
30743,Of course not.,PENNY,LEONARD
30744,Poor Roger Abbott.,RAJ,SHELDON

30746,"You guys suck.  Come on, please? He’s so big.",LEONARD,HOWARD
30747,Nope.,LEONARD,PENNY
30748,No. You told me not to.,PENNY,LEONARD
30749,But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30750,"Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?",PENNY,PENNY
30751,The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.,PENNY,SHELDON
30752,Looks like he’s doing pretty good.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30753,So it’s settled. The fate of Doctor Who’s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30754,The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.,PENNY,SHELDON
30755,"I’m sorry. Look, do you have a second.",PENNY,RAJ
30756,"Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.",PENNY,PENNY
30757,"Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30758,"Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.",LEONARD,HOWARD
30759,Hey.,PENNY,SHELDON
30760,That’s not true.,OTHERS,PENNY

30767,What happened now?,LEONARD,SHELDON
30768,"Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30769,I don’t want to go home.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30770,No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.,RAJ,SHELDON

30773,"Oh, that’s really sweet.",PENNY,HOWARD

30780,"Oh, Sheldon, stay.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30781,Yes ma’am.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30782,"You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30783,Really? Because she doesn’t actually want to go. She’s just doing it to make him happy.,OTHERS,LEONARD
30784,"Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30785,We’d come visit you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30786,"And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30787,"Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…",OTHERS,SHELDON
30788,Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.,HOWARD,HOWARD
30789,"Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.",RAJ,PENNY
30790,What if they’re women?,HOWARD,SHELDON
30791,"Yeah, sure, come on in.",PENNY,SHELDON
30792,"Of course. Here, here, let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod.",SHELDON,PENNY
30793,"All right, then break it off with the new girl.",PENNY,LEONARD
30794,"How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30795,"No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable public access.",LEONARD,PENNY
30796,"Oh, wow.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30797,"Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30798,"I’m excited to talk to you, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30799,"Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?",PENNY,SHELDON
30800,"Well, I know how to make it special.",RAJ,LEONARD
30801,"The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30802,Well?,SHELDON,HOWARD
30803,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
30804,"So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30805,Would you just look inside?,LEONARD,SHELDON
30806,"Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.",SHELDON,PENNY
30807,"Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?",SHELDON,LEONARD
30808,"Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30809,I say okey-dokey.,RAJ,RAJ
30810,Excuse me.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30811,Time machine.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30812,"Boy, do I love restrictions.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30813,"I’m sorry, is that a yes?",LEONARD,SHELDON
30814,"Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.",RAJ,LEONARD

30819,"That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news.",HOWARD,HOWARD
30820,"I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30821,Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30822,I don’t understand what you want.,LEONARD,PENNY
30823,Yes. I also found a Korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?,OTHERS,LEONARD
30824,"It’s got a big bird on it, dude.",RAJ,PENNY
30825,What are you doing?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30826,It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30827,I’m sorry. Who are you dating?,OTHERS,OTHERS
30828,"For the record, not your worst opening line.",PENNY,SHELDON
30829,I’m still going to go with you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30830,"Hello, Leonard.",SHELDON,OTHERS
30831,I can’t compete with that. Bye.,RAJ,SHELDON
30832,"Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30833,With comfy seats.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30834,"Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30835,Hi. What’s going on?,PENNY,PENNY
30836,What’s wrong?,OTHERS,PENNY
30837,Yes. But I need a wing-man.,LEONARD,LEONARD
30838,Your friend is hurting.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30839,"Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional.",PENNY,RAJ
30840,"Let me guess, you have a problem with this.",LEONARD,RAJ
30841,We did.,PENNY,LEONARD
30842,I don’t celebrate my birthday.,LEONARD,OTHERS
30843,I’m sorry.,SHELDON,PENNY
30844,"You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
30845,"Thankyou, and I’m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30846,"Next time, you should open with that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30847,Where are we going?,OTHERS,OTHERS
30848,Why are you crying?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30849,Hey.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30850,"Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30851,"Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30852,"Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.",PENNY,PENNY
30853,"Fine, whatever works.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30854,"Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30855,"See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?",LEONARD,LEONARD
30856,Why?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30857,Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.,OTHERS,RAJ
30858,"Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30859,I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.,OTHERS,HOWARD
30860,I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.,LEONARD,PENNY
30861,We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?,HOWARD,LEONARD
30862,"Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.",RAJ,SHELDON
30863,"I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30864,What other thing?,OTHERS,PENNY
30865,Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30866,And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!,LEONARD,LEONARD
30867,"So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…",LEONARD,SHELDON
30868,Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30869,What exactly are you looking up?,HOWARD,HOWARD
30870,Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.,PENNY,RAJ
30871,"Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30872,Bernie?,HOWARD,PENNY
30873,Who is it?,HOWARD,LEONARD
30874,What are you doing here?,LEONARD,PENNY
30875,I’d like to speak to Sheldon.,OTHERS,PENNY
30876,Also a good plan.,RAJ,LEONARD
30877,"Oh, are you here to see Leonard?",PENNY,SHELDON
30878,Entertain them.,PENNY,SHELDON
30879,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30880,"Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.",OTHERS,PENNY
30881,"He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30882,So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?,HOWARD,LEONARD
30883,"Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?",PENNY,LEONARD
30884,Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?,LEONARD,SHELDON
30885,Sheldon’s at the Cheesecake Factory.  Just tell him to go home.,RAJ,HOWARD
30886,Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?,SHELDON,LEONARD
30887,"Look, if you’re not ready to go back to work, we’ll figure something out.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30888,"Sheldon, I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?",PENNY,LEONARD
30889,How’s it going?,OTHERS,LEONARD
30890,You want to decorate it tonight?,LEONARD,SHELDON
30891,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30892,"Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30893,"Sorry, you’re not a dork.  You’re a clown.  Tammy Jo, don’t say that, you’ll make him feel bad.  Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?",OTHERS,LEONARD
30894,"Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30895,Gimme.,HOWARD,OTHERS
30896,"You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.",PENNY,SHELDON
30897,Leonard…,PENNY,SHELDON
30898,"No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30899,Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.,RAJ,OTHERS
30900,"Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30901,"Like, dude on dude, but with women?",RAJ,LEONARD
30902,That’s why I got you hot chocolate.,RAJ,HOWARD
30903,"Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.",OTHERS,PENNY
30904,"The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot.",HOWARD,SHELDON
30905,Are you okay?,OTHERS,LEONARD
30906,Knight to queen’s bishop-five.,RAJ,LEONARD
30907,Sure. So how can we help?,OTHERS,SHELDON
30908,That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.,SHELDON,LEONARD
30909,Howard just did that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30910,Where are you going?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30911,Do you like it?,OTHERS,RAJ
30912,"Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30913,"Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this?  Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?",PENNY,SHELDON
30914,"Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30915,"Well, what’d he say?",PENNY,PENNY
30916,Your home is twenty feet from here.,PENNY,SHELDON
30917,"Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.",OTHERS,PENNY
30918,"A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30919,"Thank you, that’s very comforting.",LEONARD,LEONARD
30920,I’m taking a bath!,HOWARD,HOWARD
30921,For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”,RAJ,SHELDON
30922,"Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30923,A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.,HOWARD,PENNY
30924,"It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.",HOWARD,RAJ
30925,So?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30926,Oh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
30927,"And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don’t have to.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30928,"Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30929,Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!,SHELDON,LEONARD
30930,Microbiology.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30931,"Yes, you’re forbidden.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30932,I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.,SHELDON,PENNY
30933,"No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?",OTHERS,SHELDON
30934,No. The moment has passed.,RAJ,LEONARD
30935,"Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?",SHELDON,OTHERS
30936,No. Start over.,SHELDON,OTHERS
30937,Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.,PENNY,SHELDON
30938,"Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska.",PENNY,LEONARD
30939,"I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30940,"Now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30941,"Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.",SHELDON,LEONARD
30942,Thank you. Bye.,LEONARD,LEONARD
30943,"Well, we don’t really have to pretend.",PENNY,PENNY
30944,Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?,OTHERS,SHELDON
30945,"A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes.",SHELDON,PENNY
30946,"I can, but she’s sitting right there.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30947,Anything else?,OTHERS,LEONARD
30948,Do you know any card tricks?,SHELDON,RAJ
30949,How hot is it?,RAJ,PENNY
30950,"Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.",PENNY,OTHERS
30951,"Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30952,"So, this wasn’t the awkward part?",PENNY,SHELDON
30953,Yeah.,PENNY,RAJ
30954,Hi.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30955,"No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30956,How is this maritime salvage?,LEONARD,LEONARD
30957,That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.,LEONARD,LEONARD
30958,"No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.",LEONARD,HOWARD
30959,That’s rough.,RAJ,SHELDON
30960,I miss you.,HOWARD,SHELDON
30961,I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.,RAJ,PENNY
30962,I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.,SHELDON,HOWARD
30963,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30964,"Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.",RAJ,HOWARD
30965,"So, have you talked to Penny yet?",HOWARD,PENNY
30966,"Oh, brilliant. I’ve been itching to pull that trigger.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30967,"Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.",PENNY,LEONARD
30968,"Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.",PENNY,PENNY
30969,Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.,SHELDON,PENNY
30970,"Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game.",SHELDON,SHELDON
30971,It was spur of the moment.,PENNY,LEONARD
30972,What?,PENNY,LEONARD
30973,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30974,"Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?",PENNY,LEONARD
30975,"Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.",PENNY,LEONARD
30976,What the hell did I do?,RAJ,RAJ
30977,Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30978,You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.,RAJ,OTHERS

30980,I’ll know.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30981,What’s he on trial for?,LEONARD,OTHERS
30982,You’re in trouble.,PENNY,PENNY
30983,"Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.",RAJ,SHELDON
30984,"You don’t want that, do you?",LEONARD,LEONARD
30985,"No! I don’t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…",PENNY,SHELDON
30986,Let’s start with your name and occupation.,OTHERS,SHELDON
30987,"I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.",OTHERS,LEONARD
30988,"Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip.",PENNY,LEONARD
30989,"No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.",SHELDON,HOWARD
30990,"I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air.",RAJ,PENNY
30991,"Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?",SHELDON,LEONARD
30992,"No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.",OTHERS,SHELDON
30993,"Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.",HOWARD,LEONARD
30994,"That’s for me to decide, not you.",OTHERS,RAJ
30995,"Oh, dear God.  Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!",SHELDON,SHELDON
30996,Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.,SHELDON,SHELDON
30997,"Sheldon, just ignore him.",LEONARD,SHELDON
30998,Great couple of gals.,HOWARD,PENNY
30999,Yeah.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31000,I saw a Thai place next door.,LEONARD,HOWARD
31001,"Hey, Sheldon’s back.",OTHERS,RAJ
31002,"Okay, have fun.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31003,"Oh, Leonard, you shouldn’t have. Oh, boy! What is it?",PENNY,OTHERS
31004,Amy’s right. He is tedious.,SHELDON,OTHERS
31005,"No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31006,Then speak.,SHELDON,HOWARD
31007,"Um, so what are you saying?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31008,"Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31009,"Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?",PENNY,SHELDON
31010,And that’s why we wear hard hats.,SHELDON,RAJ
31011,"There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31012,"Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.",SHELDON,RAJ
31013,Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31014,"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31015,"Oh, yeah.",PENNY,LEONARD
31016,Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31017,Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.,HOWARD,HOWARD
31018,So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.,SHELDON,PENNY
31019,Fine.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31020,"Okay, I have a question.",PENNY,SHELDON
31021,Hang on. Why would I be fat?,LEONARD,OTHERS
31022,Come on.,RAJ,LEONARD
31023,I’ll show you one more time. Raj?,HOWARD,LEONARD
31024,Does it matter?,OTHERS,SHELDON
31025,It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.,PENNY,LEONARD
31026,Is he quitting his job at the university?,PENNY,PENNY
31027,"So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.",PENNY,LEONARD
31028,And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31029,The other astronauts are being mean to me.,HOWARD,PENNY
31030,The two of you need to get your women in line!,SHELDON,SHELDON
31031,And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31032,What if she likes the people who work there more than us?,OTHERS,SHELDON
31033,"Oh, right. This is a disaster.",SHELDON,PENNY
31034,"No, I’m not embarrassed. I just didn’t want anyone to know because I haven’t told Leonard yet.",PENNY,SHELDON
31035,Nice to meet you.,HOWARD,LEONARD
31036,You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31037,Sorry.,LEONARD,HOWARD
31038,"Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?",LEONARD,SHELDON
31039,Everybody ready?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31040,"You may have gone to Cambridge, but I’m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31041,"No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31042,"Yeah, why?",LEONARD,PENNY
31043,"Cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31044,He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?,PENNY,SHELDON
31045,I think we should see other people.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31046,"How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.",SHELDON,PENNY
31047,You’re going.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31048,Seven of clubs! That is amazing!,PENNY,LEONARD
31049,Ba-eye.,PENNY,SHELDON
31050,"Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?",SHELDON,PENNY
31051,Are we ready on the stereo?,HOWARD,LEONARD
31052,Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31053,"Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31054,"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31055,Who’s Professor Proton?,PENNY,SHELDON
31056,"Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!",RAJ,SHELDON
31057,What are you doing here?,LEONARD,SHELDON
31058,"She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31059,"Yes. Oh, I’m so excited. And I just can’t hide it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31060,"Yes, please, Penny will kill me.",OTHERS,RAJ
31061,"On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?",RAJ,HOWARD
31062,"But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31063,"Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31064,"I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow.",OTHERS,PENNY
31065,"Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?",PENNY,SHELDON
31066,"Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?",OTHERS,LEONARD
31067,It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31068,Okay?,LEONARD,HOWARD
31069,What are you doing?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31070,"Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t.",SHELDON,RAJ
31071,Yes.,PENNY,SHELDON
31072,"Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31073,Problem solved.,PENNY,SHELDON
31074,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
31075,Too late.,HOWARD,LEONARD
31076,You look like a jackass.,RAJ,SHELDON
31077,"Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.",OTHERS,OTHERS
31078,"Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31079,"Ugh, I am so embarrassed!",PENNY,SHELDON
31080,"You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?",SHELDON,OTHERS
31081,"Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31082,"No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31083,You didn’t really type.,SHELDON,HOWARD
31084,I’m not.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31085,"Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31086,"I can’t, it’ll break his heart. You know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside.",PENNY,HOWARD
31087,"Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31088,"I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.",LEONARD,HOWARD
31089,"Wait, wait, what am I going to do?",PENNY,LEONARD
31090,"Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.",PENNY,SHELDON
31091,Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31092,"There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31093,"No, no, I meant…",PENNY,LEONARD
31094,"Oh, hey, guys. What brings you here?",OTHERS,LEONARD
31095,A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31096,It’s like looking at the universe naked.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31097,"I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I’ll be changing their names.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31098,I’m fine.,HOWARD,PENNY
31099,Is there too much pepper on your salad?,SHELDON,HOWARD
31100,Hope you’re hungry.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31101,Not really.,HOWARD,PENNY
31102,In a nutshell.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31103,"I mean, why would you say that?",HOWARD,HOWARD
31104,"Oh, how I wish I could.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31105,What’s that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31106,"Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31107,"Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31108,"Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.",RAJ,LEONARD
31109,To the bedroom.,LEONARD,HOWARD
31110,"Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31111,"We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…",PENNY,PENNY
31112,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31113,"Leonard, we need a ruling.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31114,"Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?",PENNY,PENNY
31115,"Three, two, one.",RAJ,PENNY
31116,"Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?",SHELDON,PENNY
31117,"Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.",PENNY,PENNY
31118,Sheldor?,PENNY,SHELDON
31119,Nice to meet you.,OTHERS,RAJ
31120,"Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?",SHELDON,PENNY
31121,Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?,SHELDON,OTHERS
31122,You’re right. You realize what this means?,RAJ,LEONARD
31123,Brawny?,PENNY,LEONARD
31124,"To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31125,"There, see? Problem solved.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31126,"Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!",LEONARD,SHELDON
31127,He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.,PENNY,SHELDON
31128,What?,LEONARD,LEONARD
31129,That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.,OTHERS,PENNY
31130,What kind of deal?,PENNY,SHELDON
31131,Or we could just wing it.,PENNY,PENNY
31132,"Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.",OTHERS,OTHERS
31133,"Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.",SHELDON,RAJ
31134,Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.,LEONARD,PENNY
31135,"Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.",PENNY,SHELDON
31136,"Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?",SHELDON,SHELDON
31137,"And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.",OTHERS,PENNY
31138,You can’t just throw everything in the closet.,OTHERS,PENNY
31139,"Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.",SHELDON,RAJ
31140,"Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31141,"You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31142,"Good point, I’m in.",LEONARD,OTHERS
31143,Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.,LEONARD,PENNY
31144,Sure.,HOWARD,OTHERS
31145,I thought you liked Halloween.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31146,"And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done.",RAJ,SHELDON
31147,Sorry.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31148,"How ya doin’, buddy?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31149,"You won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31150,"You’re out too, by the way.",SHELDON,PENNY
31151,"Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31152,"Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.",PENNY,LEONARD
31153,"What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?",SHELDON,SHELDON
31154,What… what kind of a kiss?,RAJ,LEONARD
31155,"All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31156,"I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31157,"No, I suppose not.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31158,Why?,LEONARD,OTHERS
31159,"Yeah, what?",LEONARD,SHELDON
31160,I haven’t had sex in a year.,RAJ,LEONARD
31161,"Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?",OTHERS,LEONARD
31162,"No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.",RAJ,PENNY
31163,Him.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31164,Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31165,"Hey, I got you a little gift.",RAJ,LEONARD
31166,I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31167,"Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?",HOWARD,RAJ
31168,Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.,PENNY,SHELDON
31169,In the prom department.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31170,"Yes, I do.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31171,"Show a little compassion, a man died.",HOWARD,PENNY
31172,"No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31173,What is happening?,LEONARD,RAJ
31174,"Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.",PENNY,PENNY
31175,I’ll miss you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31176,"Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?",PENNY,HOWARD
31177,"Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31178,"Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.",HOWARD,PENNY
31179,He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31180,You will?,RAJ,LEONARD
31181,"Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.",OTHERS,PENNY
31182,Okay.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31183,"As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31184,"I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all I care.",PENNY,PENNY
31185,Okay.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31186,"I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?",SHELDON,PENNY
31187,I don’t have homework. I’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!,HOWARD,PENNY
31188,Some what?,LEONARD,SHELDON
31189,"No, you’re not gonna tell them anything. You’re gonna stay out of it.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31190,"So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?",OTHERS,PENNY
31191,"Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.",RAJ,SHELDON
31192,"Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31193,"I don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31194,I believe this is yours.,HOWARD,PENNY
31195,I love you.,LEONARD,PENNY
31196,Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31197,Kumquat?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31198,It’s fine.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31199,"Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31200,"Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.",RAJ,PENNY
31201,"The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31202,"I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened.",LEONARD,PENNY
31203,Good. Get out.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31204,"I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31205,"Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31206,Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31207,Drat.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31208,But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?,PENNY,PENNY
31209,"You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31210,You really think so?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31211,I got you a little something to cheer you up.,PENNY,LEONARD
31212,"Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person.",PENNY,RAJ
31213,You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31214,Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31215,You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you.,SHELDON,RAJ
31216,Why should I worry?,PENNY,OTHERS
31217,"That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31218,"Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.",OTHERS,PENNY
31219,What’s wrong?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31220,"You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.",PENNY,HOWARD
31221,"It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31222,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it, no one else can see it.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31223,You can make him do anything you want.,RAJ,PENNY

31225,Yes.,SHELDON,PENNY
31226,I love you so much.,HOWARD,LEONARD
31227,What?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31228,"No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31229,Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,SHELDON,SHELDON

31232,"Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31233,"My God! Why don’t you just tell them I’m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31234,Additional data. You dog.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31235,"Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31236,"Oh, damn it!",LEONARD,RAJ
31237,"No, but I was awake all night.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31238,He thinks there’s a difference.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31239,"You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31240,"Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?",PENNY,LEONARD
31241,That is a great idea.,RAJ,RAJ
31242,It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31243,It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31244,"Fine, they smelled good.",HOWARD,PENNY
31245,"So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?",OTHERS,PENNY
31246,I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31247,"It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.",SHELDON,PENNY
31248,I don’t understand.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31249,Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.,HOWARD,LEONARD

31251,"No, no, I didn’t say better, I said less stained.",PENNY,HOWARD
31252,We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.,PENNY,LEONARD
31253,"Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?",SHELDON,LEONARD
31254,Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.,LEONARD,OTHERS
31255,"Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?",PENNY,SHELDON
31256,"First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31257,"I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?",OTHERS,LEONARD
31258,Sheldon.,HOWARD,PENNY
31259,"Hey, I know Sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31260,"No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might’ve said yes.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31261,I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31262,I don’t know what to say.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31263,"We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right.",OTHERS,PENNY
31264,"Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31265,"Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31266,Offer them a hot beverage.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31267,"I do, I see it.",OTHERS,PENNY
31268,"I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31269,"Oh, hi.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31270,"How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31271,Happy birthday to you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31272,"It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!",SHELDON,LEONARD
31273,"Come on, he’s not that cute.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31274,And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.,LEONARD,PENNY
31275,"Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?",SHELDON,SHELDON
31276,"So, how have you been?",HOWARD,LEONARD
31277,It would be humiliating.,PENNY,LEONARD
31278,I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.,PENNY,LEONARD
31279,"I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31280,Hi.,RAJ,HOWARD
31281,"I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.",SHELDON,PENNY
31282,"Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.",OTHERS,PENNY
31283,Not right now.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31284,"So, yes.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31285,My favourite part is your shower scene.,OTHERS,PENNY
31286,We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.,LEONARD,HOWARD
31287,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.,RAJ,SHELDON
31288,Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31289,This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.,LEONARD,RAJ
31290,Nothing.,HOWARD,PENNY
31291,"Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.",RAJ,HOWARD
31292,"Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose.",PENNY,HOWARD
31293,"Oh, sounds great.",LEONARD,OTHERS
31294,"Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31295,Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.,RAJ,PENNY
31296,"Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31297,Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.,HOWARD,PENNY
31298,"Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure.",OTHERS,PENNY
31299,What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31300,Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31301,"Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31302,You sure you’re okay?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31303,"Okay, well, what’s the third option?",PENNY,HOWARD
31304,"If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31305,"Answer the question, what are you doing here?",RAJ,RAJ
31306,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31307,I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.,SHELDON,PENNY
31308,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
31309,"No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.",SHELDON,RAJ
31310,Are you here for the conference?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31311,"Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31312,I think that’s enough wine for now.,OTHERS,PENNY
31313,"Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you’re gonna melt.",HOWARD,OTHERS
31314,"Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31315,"But, Sheldon, we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.",RAJ,SHELDON
31316,Very nice. You lie to my sister.,RAJ,SHELDON
31317,I erotically caress your  nose.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31318,"I’m not a child, don’t do that.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31319,"Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31320,And you think my presence will help with that?,LEONARD,PENNY
31321,"Uh, well, actually I came to see you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31322,There’s no mistake.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31323,"Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.",PENNY,OTHERS
31324,"Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.",RAJ,SHELDON
31325,"Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.",SHELDON,PENNY
31326,"I’m not going, and you can’t make me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31327,I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…,HOWARD,OTHERS
31328,"Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?",RAJ,LEONARD
31329,"Uh, yeah, sure.",LEONARD,OTHERS
31330,She’s not that intelligent.,SHELDON,OTHERS
31331,"No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake.  Oh, I’ll get it.",PENNY,SHELDON
31332,"A car, yeah.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31333,"Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?",PENNY,SHELDON
31334,Happy Star Wars Day.,OTHERS,PENNY
31335,"Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.",HOWARD,PENNY
31336,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31337,"No, I love it.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31338,Really? Us gonna tell him?,RAJ,SHELDON
31339,Mmm.,LEONARD,OTHERS
31340,Grass is always greener?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31341,"This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31342,"You know what? I missed you, too.",PENNY,OTHERS
31343,"Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31344,"Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.",SHELDON,RAJ
31345,"Oh, my…",PENNY,PENNY
31346,They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.,HOWARD,PENNY
31347,Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31348,"Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.",RAJ,PENNY
31349,"Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?",HOWARD,RAJ
31350,Very well.,SHELDON,PENNY
31351,"Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!",LEONARD,SHELDON
31352,"Oh, no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.",SHELDON,PENNY
31353,"If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31354,"Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31355,"Gee, why wouldn’t I?",LEONARD,SHELDON
31356,I’m sweating out of my head.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31357,It’s really nice to see you again Leonard.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31358,Yeah.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31359,"Yes, Miss Amy.",SHELDON,PENNY
31360,"I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!",SHELDON,PENNY
31361,"Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?",SHELDON,OTHERS
31362,I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31363,"Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31364,Can you finish it later?,LEONARD,HOWARD
31365,I’m gonna go.,PENNY,LEONARD
31366,Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31367,Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.,HOWARD,LEONARD
31368,What’s his problem?,HOWARD,LEONARD
31369,Raj.  Raj.  Raj.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31370,Sorry papa.,RAJ,SHELDON
31371,But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.,RAJ,LEONARD
31372,"No, I went down the stairs too fast.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31373,I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.,LEONARD,OTHERS
31374,"Oh, dear.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31375,"Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?",HOWARD,OTHERS
31376,"Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.",RAJ,SHELDON
31377,"No, you didn’t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.",RAJ,LEONARD
31378,"Yes, it is, Wil.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31379,Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31380,"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.",SHELDON,PENNY
31381,Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?,SHELDON,HOWARD
31382,"Actually that helps, thank you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31383,Is this about the baby?,OTHERS,HOWARD
31384,Robot prostitute.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31385,"No. No, you don’t, you really don’t. I actually can’t say don’t enough.",PENNY,SHELDON
31386,"Mrs Bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock.",RAJ,LEONARD
31387,"Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31388,You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.,RAJ,RAJ
31389,There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31390,"Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31391,"If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31392,He just won’t listen to me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31393,Son of a bitch.,RAJ,LEONARD
31394,Damn it. I slipped.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31395,"My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31396,Why don’t you ask her?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31397,All right. Pass the soy sauce.,PENNY,SHELDON
31398,"Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?",RAJ,LEONARD
31399,Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?,LEONARD,LEONARD
31400,"You know, I hadn’t thought of that.  Help me.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31401,"Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31402,Yeah. Come in.,PENNY,SHELDON
31403,"No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31404,How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?,OTHERS,RAJ
31405,I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31406,"So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?",LEONARD,PENNY
31407,"Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.",LEONARD,OTHERS
31408,"Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?",SHELDON,LEONARD
31409,"Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31410,"Okay, show’s over.",PENNY,LEONARD
31411,"No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister.",RAJ,SHELDON
31412,Of course. Out of respect.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31413,What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31414,"Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31415,"What are you saying, that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?",PENNY,SHELDON
31416,I never said that.,PENNY,RAJ
31417,Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.,SHELDON,HOWARD
31418,Will you guys keep it down?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31419,"Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner.",RAJ,SHELDON
31420,You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?,LEONARD,SHELDON
31421,"Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31422,"Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.",RAJ,LEONARD
31423,Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.,HOWARD,PENNY
31424,It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.,RAJ,LEONARD
31425,How you doing over there?,PENNY,LEONARD
31426,"Oh, you’re good at this.",LEONARD,PENNY
31427,We’d have to take your car.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31428,"Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?",LEONARD,SHELDON
31429,"The uterus quivers, does it not?",OTHERS,SHELDON
31430,"I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31431,I don’t know. What difference does it make?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31432,Pastries such as bearclaws?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31433,"Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?",RAJ,LEONARD
31434,"Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31435,Here we go.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31436,"Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that’s soothing.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31437,"I’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31438,That’s why I sit.,HOWARD,RAJ
31439,"He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?",SHELDON,SHELDON
31440,You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31441,"Hey, can you open this for me?",LEONARD,SHELDON
31442,How big a box of chocolate was it?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31443,All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31444,I saw what you did there.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31445,"Yeah, you tell him, Penny.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31446,"Oh, my God, you’re jealous.",LEONARD,HOWARD
31447,That’s what I said when we moved it.,RAJ,PENNY
31448,What can we do?,RAJ,LEONARD
31449,"Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?",LEONARD,RAJ
31450,Seconded.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31451,"Mmm, I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.",RAJ,LEONARD
31452,"Oh, okay. Well, I guess it’s just the two of us, huh?",PENNY,SHELDON
31453,Do you understand how creepy this is.,PENNY,OTHERS
31454,"With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31455,Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?,SHELDON,PENNY
31456,"Oh, thank you.",PENNY,HOWARD
31457,"Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?",RAJ,SHELDON
31458,"So, what do you say, Amy?",OTHERS,SHELDON
31459,"Come on, do it with us.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31460,"Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31461,"Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31462,Yeah. Good or devastating.,RAJ,LEONARD
31463,Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31464,"No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.",SHELDON,PENNY
31465,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.,SHELDON,RAJ
31466,"Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31467,"Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?",PENNY,SHELDON
31468,"Well, I can, so shut up.",LEONARD,PENNY
31469,Disappointed? Let down?,RAJ,SHELDON
31470,"Hi, you guys ready to order?",PENNY,PENNY
31471,All of them.,SHELDON,RAJ
31472,Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.,PENNY,SHELDON
31473,"You’re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.",HOWARD,RAJ
31474,What? Why?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31475,"So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.",OTHERS,PENNY
31476,Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?,PENNY,SHELDON
31477,"Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31478,Amy’s upset? Is it about me?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31479,Are you kidding me?,PENNY,LEONARD
31480,"Oh, give it a rest.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31481,"If I were you, I’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31482,Yeah! Funny how things work out.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31483,"Really, never?",PENNY,SHELDON
31484,I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.,HOWARD,PENNY
31485,"Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.",HOWARD,RAJ
31486,This means a lot.,RAJ,PENNY
31487,"Next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31488,"Oh, we were just chatting.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31489,"All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.",HOWARD,HOWARD
31490,"Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.",PENNY,PENNY
31491,"No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?",OTHERS,SHELDON
31492,"All right, I’ve got your back.",RAJ,LEONARD
31493,"Oh, yeah, you, too.",PENNY,OTHERS
31494,"Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31495,I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31496,"Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.",PENNY,LEONARD
31497,I thought it was funny.,RAJ,HOWARD
31498,I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31499,I’m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth’s L-Five Lagrange point.,OTHERS,HOWARD
31500,You are a dirty girl.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31501,"Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley.",PENNY,PENNY
31502,"So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?",PENNY,LEONARD
31503,Beg pardon?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31504,Love you more.,HOWARD,PENNY
31505,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31506,Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.,PENNY,SHELDON
31507,"No, I mean just you and me.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31508,And to the sick and dying who make it possible.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31509,Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?,HOWARD,SHELDON
31510,"Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem.",PENNY,HOWARD
31511,Yes.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31512,"Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him.",LEONARD,PENNY
31513,"It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31514,"If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31515,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31516,Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.,HOWARD,PENNY
31517,"Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!",PENNY,HOWARD
31518,Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?,SHELDON,HOWARD
31519,"Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…",PENNY,LEONARD
31520,And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!,SHELDON,RAJ
31521,So should we talk to each other or mingle?,PENNY,LEONARD
31522,"You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31523,"Wow, it’s really coming down.",OTHERS,OTHERS
31524,Are you serious?,RAJ,LEONARD
31525,"Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out.",PENNY,HOWARD
31526,"That’s great, you guys have to go.",LEONARD,PENNY
31527,"Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.",PENNY,LEONARD
31528,"An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?",SHELDON,SHELDON
31529,So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?,OTHERS,PENNY
31530,I might just take you up on that.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31531,"La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31532,I know the reason.,PENNY,LEONARD
31533,"Good day, Sheldon Cooper.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31534,"We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31535,"Can you get the butter, please?",OTHERS,LEONARD
31536,Doesn’t sound very romantic.,LEONARD,PENNY
31537,"Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31538,I have a confession to make.,PENNY,RAJ
31539,"Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31540,Oh.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31541,"Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31542,"Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.",HOWARD,PENNY
31543,Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31544,"And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive.",RAJ,HOWARD
31545,Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31546,We are not having coitus.,PENNY,SHELDON
31547,"Oh, it’s okay.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31548,Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.,RAJ,HOWARD
31549,"Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.",PENNY,SHELDON
31550,Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.,OTHERS,RAJ
31551,Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.,LEONARD,PENNY
31552,"Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31553,"So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.",RAJ,SHELDON
31554,"Well, I’m a scientist by training.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31555,Really?,PENNY,PENNY
31556,"You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?",SHELDON,SHELDON
31557,Yup.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31558,"No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31559,I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.,SHELDON,PENNY
31560,"Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?",LEONARD,OTHERS
31561,"Sheldon, I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.",PENNY,SHELDON
31562,I don’t like this game.,SHELDON,PENNY
31563,You’re in trouble.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31564,Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31565,"Okay. Good, good talk.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31566,"You liked my short hair, right?",PENNY,PENNY
31567,Ready to play when you are.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31568,"I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31569,So what exactly do you want us to do?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31570,Sheldon has a girlfriend?,PENNY,LEONARD
31571,"I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy.",HOWARD,RAJ
31572,He’s speaking about it.,HOWARD,HOWARD
31573,"Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.",SHELDON,PENNY
31574,It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31575,"Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you’re ready.",PENNY,PENNY
31576,What is this?,LEONARD,SHELDON
31577,Smooth.,LEONARD,PENNY
31578,"Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.",LEONARD,PENNY
31579,I don’t understand.,LEONARD,HOWARD
31580,"Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was….",PENNY,LEONARD
31581,We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31582,Great.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31583,Yeah.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31584,You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31585,"You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…",SHELDON,PENNY
31586,"Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31587,"Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?",SHELDON,RAJ
31588,"Don’t feel bad, Penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31589,"Oh, um, I should probably get going.",PENNY,PENNY
31590,"Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.",OTHERS,PENNY
31591,Great.,LEONARD,PENNY
31592,"Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…",PENNY,LEONARD
31593,"I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31594,Hmm.,SHELDON,HOWARD
31595,No problem.,PENNY,PENNY
31596,"Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.",OTHERS,RAJ
31597,Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31598,And?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31599,"Me, too.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31600,"Hey, guys, what do you think?",PENNY,SHELDON
31601,It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31602,"Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.",SHELDON,PENNY
31603,The gun from Hellboy?,RAJ,LEONARD
31604,Notice people on your own time. We’re working.,SHELDON,OTHERS
31605,"Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31606,No. Sulfites. Migraines.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31607,You mean my ring?,SHELDON,HOWARD
31608,"And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?",OTHERS,PENNY
31609,Oh.,PENNY,LEONARD
31610,Of course.,SHELDON,HOWARD
31611,Just do it!,OTHERS,PENNY
31612,Fine. Just a little tired.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31613,What?,PENNY,OTHERS
31614,"They could show bloopers. Oh, no.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31615,"Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.",PENNY,SHELDON
31616,"Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31617,How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?,LEONARD,RAJ
31618,"I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31619,"The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31620,I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31621,"No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That’s pretty cool.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31622,Thinly veiled contempt.,PENNY,HOWARD
31623,"You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?",OTHERS,LEONARD
31624,Do you know what he’s talking about?,RAJ,PENNY
31625,I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.,OTHERS,PENNY
31626,She.,PENNY,SHELDON
31627,Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?,PENNY,HOWARD
31628,Uh-huh.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31629,Ready to go?,HOWARD,PENNY
31630,I’m having a panic attack.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31631,"I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased  that Leonard has found someone  that makes him so happy.",PENNY,PENNY
31632,I was going to put down a towel.,HOWARD,PENNY
31633,"Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.",PENNY,OTHERS
31634,Why?,OTHERS,SHELDON
31635,What are you making?,HOWARD,PENNY
31636,You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?,LEONARD,LEONARD
31637,You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.,PENNY,PENNY
31638,They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31639,"Well, shall we start over?",OTHERS,RAJ
31640,Hey.,RAJ,PENNY
31641,"She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s playing non-stop.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31642,"Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.",HOWARD,PENNY
31643,"Yeah, I don’t think I need my preshow urination anymore.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31644,What?,PENNY,SHELDON
31645,"Okay, who’s up first?",HOWARD,OTHERS
31646,"Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.",PENNY,SHELDON
31647,Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.,PENNY,PENNY
31648,What’s all this?,PENNY,SHELDON
31649,"Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31650,Right. So all we need is to…,LEONARD,SHELDON
31651,"Oh, good.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31652,"No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.",OTHERS,PENNY
31653,"Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.",LEONARD,RAJ
31654,What?,RAJ,LEONARD
31655,"Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31656,"Oh, I shall.  No!",SHELDON,SHELDON
31657,It’s a lease.,RAJ,HOWARD
31658,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31659,"Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.",LEONARD,HOWARD
31660,Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.,HOWARD,PENNY
31661,That’s ridiculous.,PENNY,SHELDON
31662,"Great timing, food just got here.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31663,I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.,PENNY,SHELDON
31664,"Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31665,"Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31666,Maybe later.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31667,"Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31668,I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.,OTHERS,OTHERS
31669,We brought snacks for movie night.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31670,"Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.",PENNY,LEONARD
31671,"Okay, where is he going?",PENNY,PENNY
31672,Sheldon? Hello?,LEONARD,LEONARD
31673,I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31674,No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.,SHELDON,OTHERS
31675,We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.,SHELDON,RAJ
31676,"Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment.",PENNY,PENNY
31677,"Sheldon, I wasn’t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she’s my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren’t I allowed to help her?",LEONARD,PENNY
31678,"Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.",RAJ,LEONARD
31679,"Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.",PENNY,LEONARD
31680,That’s so nice.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31681,You read it as oh eight hundred.,HOWARD,OTHERS
31682,Oh. How’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?,HOWARD,HOWARD
31683,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.,RAJ,PENNY
31684,Are you ready to apologize?,PENNY,SHELDON
31685,"Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31686,Maybe another time.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31687,"Leonard, have you gotten married yet?",SHELDON,LEONARD
31688,I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31689,"You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.",PENNY,SHELDON
31690,Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?,RAJ,LEONARD
31691,I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31692,"There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!",SHELDON,HOWARD
31693,"So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31694,Yeah.,HOWARD,RAJ
31695,"Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,",SHELDON,SHELDON
31696,"Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31697,Is it kung pao chicken?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31698,"Oh, I’m out of line?",OTHERS,SHELDON
31699,You have hypo-allergenic detergent?,HOWARD,LEONARD
31700,"Sheldon, let’s go.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31701,"It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.",RAJ,PENNY
31702,"Howie, this is just your hypochondria.",OTHERS,RAJ
31703,"I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.",RAJ,SHELDON
31704,"Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.",LEONARD,HOWARD
31705,Two.,SHELDON,PENNY
31706,"I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.",SHELDON,OTHERS
31707,I’m not going in there.,HOWARD,PENNY
31708,I did not have sex with 31 guys.,PENNY,OTHERS
31709,He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.,SHELDON,PENNY
31710,Well that’s disappointing.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31711,"You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.",PENNY,PENNY
31712,"Answer the phone, Leonard.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31713,Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.,RAJ,RAJ
31714,"Oh yeah, look at that.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31715,Two cherries?,SHELDON,HOWARD
31716,This is money I’m not using.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31717,"Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy’s Facebook page and read up on her interests.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31718,Couple of weeks.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31719,I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31720,"Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?",PENNY,LEONARD
31721,Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?,RAJ,SHELDON
31722,"Okay, Merry Christmas.",PENNY,PENNY
31723,"Um, Raj, honey, you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me.",PENNY,LEONARD
31724,Mm-hmm.,PENNY,SHELDON
31725,"Oh, I can’t believe that.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31726,So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?,LEONARD,LEONARD
31727,"Uh, just give us a few minutes.",LEONARD,OTHERS
31728,I can’t believe it.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31729,Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31730,"So, my mother’s okay with this?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31731,I could’ve driven her.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31732,"Hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?",PENNY,LEONARD
31733,Penny?  Penny?  Penny?,SHELDON,PENNY
31734,I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.,PENNY,LEONARD
31735,"Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31736,Really? Wasn’t it great?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31737,Yeah.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31738,"She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?",LEONARD,OTHERS
31739,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31740,Hi.,PENNY,SHELDON
31741,"Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31742,"So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.",RAJ,SHELDON
31743,"Sure, Dad.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31744,"Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31745,Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.,RAJ,PENNY
31746,That’s not the comforting part.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31747,"Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.",SHELDON,OTHERS
31748,"Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31749,"Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.",PENNY,SHELDON
31750,Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.,OTHERS,HOWARD
31751,"You get a cookie, too.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31752,"Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31753,Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31754,"Thank you, sir.",RAJ,LEONARD
31755,"That’s not fair, she has upper body muscles.",HOWARD,HOWARD
31756,Where are your tools?,RAJ,HOWARD
31757,Yes.,LEONARD,PENNY
31758,What is everyone booing at?,RAJ,SHELDON
31759,You mean my special day?,OTHERS,SHELDON
31760,"How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.",HOWARD,OTHERS
31761,Like what?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31762,"Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.",SHELDON,PENNY
31763,Who?,OTHERS,PENNY
31764,"Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.",RAJ,RAJ
31765,Why would you know that?,HOWARD,LEONARD
31766,And the car ride puts her to sleep.,HOWARD,PENNY
31767,"I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31768,"That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31769,"Yeah, since when do you take walks?",HOWARD,LEONARD
31770,How did you get it?,RAJ,LEONARD
31771,"Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.",RAJ,SHELDON
31772,I can’t sleep. how are you going?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31773,So?,SHELDON,HOWARD
31774,"I’m proud of you, Sheldon.",OTHERS,PENNY
31775,"Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31776,"Arthur, what brings you back?",SHELDON,HOWARD
31777,"Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.",HOWARD,HOWARD
31778,What? Why didn’t you say anything?,OTHERS,SHELDON
31779,Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31780,This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.,RAJ,LEONARD
31781,"Oh, I hate when that happens.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31782,"Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31783,Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31784,Do you do this often?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31785,There’s only one clear choice.,OTHERS,LEONARD

31787,Who’s the bobblehead of?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31788,"It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31789,Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.,PENNY,PENNY
31790,Sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I guess I just love love.,OTHERS,OTHERS

31792,"No, no, wait, hold on.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31793,"That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!",PENNY,HOWARD
31794,"Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31795,Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31796,You got it.,RAJ,LEONARD
31797,You guys have fun.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31798,You say things like that all the time.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31799,"Three, four months.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31800,Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31801,Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31802,I am.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31803,"Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we’re making out?",HOWARD,PENNY
31804,"No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!",HOWARD,SHELDON
31805,Yeah.,PENNY,SHELDON
31806,"Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…",PENNY,SHELDON
31807,"No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.",LEONARD,LEONARD

31810,I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31811,"Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31812,"Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.",LEONARD,RAJ
31813,"It won’t work, the flower’s too porous.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31814,"Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.",RAJ,HOWARD
31815,He’s so nice.,OTHERS,HOWARD
31816,Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”,RAJ,SHELDON
31817,"What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.",LEONARD,PENNY
31818,"Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.",RAJ,PENNY
31819,"You heard him, guys, don’t ask.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31820,"Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31821,"Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.",LEONARD,PENNY
31822,Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.,SHELDON,OTHERS
31823,"Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.",PENNY,SHELDON
31824,"I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide.",SHELDON,OTHERS
31825,Hey.,HOWARD,PENNY
31826,Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31827,Not now.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31828,Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.,OTHERS,OTHERS
31829,"I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31830,"So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31831,I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?,PENNY,SHELDON

31835,Mine has a fully developed immune system.,OTHERS,OTHERS
31836,Our shower works.,LEONARD,PENNY
31837,You’re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31838,"Hey, I buzzed in.",HOWARD,PENNY
31839,"How did you even get in, you weirdo?",PENNY,HOWARD
31840,"Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.",PENNY,SHELDON
31841,"Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?",HOWARD,SHELDON
31842,Do you need anything else?,OTHERS,SHELDON
31843,Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.,PENNY,SHELDON
31844,"Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.",SHELDON,HOWARD
31845,"Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.",RAJ,RAJ
31846,"Oh, come on.  There, butt print.",PENNY,HOWARD
31847,You mean dating?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31848,"Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31849,Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.,RAJ,SHELDON
31850,LeVar Burton?  LeVar Burton?  LeVar Burton?,SHELDON,LEONARD

31852,I wasn’t joking.,RAJ,SHELDON
31853,"Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.",SHELDON,PENNY
31854,"Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?",LEONARD,HOWARD
31855,"No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31856,"If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy.",RAJ,OTHERS
31857,"Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.",SHELDON,RAJ
31858,"The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.",OTHERS,OTHERS
31859,"Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.",RAJ,SHELDON
31860,Go away.,HOWARD,RAJ
31861,"Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.",RAJ,LEONARD
31862,Nice to finally meet you in person.,OTHERS,RAJ
31863,"So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?",PENNY,OTHERS
31864,"Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends.",OTHERS,PENNY
31865,Like he’s been doing since he got here.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31866,"Oh, that means so much. I love you.",PENNY,SHELDON
31867,"Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31868,"Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31869,Aw.,PENNY,PENNY

31871,"Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.",RAJ,SHELDON
31872,"Hello, sailor.",OTHERS,LEONARD
31873,What the hell is your problem?,PENNY,HOWARD
31874,"Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples.",HOWARD,RAJ
31875,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31876,Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.,SHELDON,PENNY
31877,Hello.,HOWARD,LEONARD
31878,"Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.",RAJ,HOWARD
31879,"And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.",RAJ,SHELDON
31880,Dayaj’a’,SHELDON,SHELDON
31881,It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31882,"No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.",OTHERS,PENNY
31883,Penny.,LEONARD,OTHERS
31884,No.,RAJ,OTHERS
31885,"Hey, anybody want a drink?",PENNY,PENNY
31886,"No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…",SHELDON,SHELDON
31887,I had a little to do with it.,HOWARD,HOWARD
31888,"Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!",OTHERS,LEONARD
31889,Very funny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31890,Agh!,OTHERS,LEONARD
31891,You’re kidding.,PENNY,PENNY
31892,"Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31893,"Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.",RAJ,PENNY
31894,"We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me.",PENNY,OTHERS
31895,"Mmm, these are so good",PENNY,LEONARD
31896,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?",HOWARD,LEONARD
31897,"Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.",HOWARD,OTHERS
31898,Name one.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31899,"Wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys.",PENNY,OTHERS
31900,I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31901,Yes he is.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31902,"I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.",SHELDON,OTHERS
31903,"Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!",PENNY,LEONARD
31904,"Hey, what’re you working on?",HOWARD,LEONARD
31905,Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.,SHELDON,RAJ
31906,"Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?",SHELDON,OTHERS
31907,No.,PENNY,LEONARD
31908,"Hah, yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.",PENNY,RAJ
31909,"So, where’s your roommate tonight?",RAJ,PENNY
31910,"It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31911,"Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31912,"Okay, Mother. Have fun.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31913,"Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.",SHELDON,RAJ
31914,You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.,OTHERS,HOWARD
31915,"What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it.",PENNY,PENNY
31916,"Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.",LEONARD,PENNY
31917,"Guys, I’m not living in a garage.",RAJ,PENNY
31918,Really?,RAJ,LEONARD
31919,Hey.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31920,"That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.",HOWARD,OTHERS
31921,I’m surprised you would do that.,OTHERS,PENNY
31922,"Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.",PENNY,SHELDON
31923,"Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.",LEONARD,PENNY
31924,We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.,RAJ,LEONARD
31925,"Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31926,"Yeah, I’m just making a mess.",PENNY,PENNY
31927,I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.,PENNY,OTHERS
31928,How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?,PENNY,PENNY
31929,"Well, I’m proud of you.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31930,A what?,PENNY,SHELDON
31931,"Why? I mean, okay.",LEONARD,PENNY
31932,I know what he looks like.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31933,We’ll never know.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31934,How are your crab cakes?,RAJ,HOWARD
31935,"Look, it’s Stuart.",PENNY,HOWARD
31936,"I’m sorry, Sheldon.",OTHERS,RAJ
31937,"I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31938,Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?,PENNY,LEONARD
31939,"Oh, just my parents and my entire family.",PENNY,LEONARD
31940,Okay.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31941,Really?,SHELDON,PENNY
31942,What’s a multiverse?,PENNY,SHELDON
31943,"How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.",RAJ,HOWARD
31944,Yeah.,PENNY,PENNY
31945,It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.,PENNY,LEONARD
31946,"No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.",SHELDON,LEONARD
31947,"Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31948,Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31949,Yes,LEONARD,PENNY
31950,"Ah, it’s Penny.",LEONARD,LEONARD
31951,I’m surprised you know that reference.,LEONARD,LEONARD
31952,You guys are making me nervous.,LEONARD,PENNY
31953,I couldn’t explain it if I tried.,OTHERS,LEONARD
31954,And I’m a little busy right now.,OTHERS,RAJ
31955,"Okay, I’m good now.",PENNY,OTHERS
31956,I don’t think I can.,HOWARD,LEONARD
31957,"I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here?",SHELDON,PENNY
31958,"Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.",HOWARD,RAJ
31959,"Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.",LEONARD,SHELDON
31960,"But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me.",HOWARD,SHELDON
31961,"Oh. Us Indian, or “come to our casino” Indian?",OTHERS,HOWARD
31962,Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?,SHELDON,SHELDON
31963,Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.,PENNY,SHELDON
31964,How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?,SHELDON,LEONARD
31965,Yeah. Cool.,OTHERS,SHELDON
31966,"None, why?",LEONARD,LEONARD
31967,Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.,SHELDON,LEONARD
31968,What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?,RAJ,SHELDON
31969,Okay.,PENNY,SHELDON
31970,"Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married.",OTHERS,HOWARD
31971,"You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride.",RAJ,PENNY
31972,Just eat.,LEONARD,SHELDON
31973,"Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.",PENNY,SHELDON
31974,Thank you. I…,LEONARD,HOWARD
31975,What’s wrong with your face?,LEONARD,LEONARD
31976,"If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now.",HOWARD,LEONARD
31977,No.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31978,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31979,"Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.",PENNY,LEONARD
31980,"We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know.",SHELDON,PENNY
31981,"I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31982,"Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.",SHELDON,RAJ
31983,Don’t speak.,LEONARD,PENNY
31984,"That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.",SHELDON,PENNY
31985,"Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31986,"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing Halo.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31987,"Okay, Priya?",PENNY,SHELDON
31988,Not really. I was in my boogie zone.,HOWARD,SHELDON
31989,I do.,LEONARD,PENNY
31990,"Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.",SHELDON,SHELDON
31991,"Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.",OTHERS,SHELDON
31992,"You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.",PENNY,PENNY
31993,Right.,PENNY,OTHERS
31994,Come here.,LEONARD,HOWARD
31995,No. I quit.,SHELDON,SHELDON
31996,"I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?",SHELDON,OTHERS
31997,Do you think you could introduce me to him?,OTHERS,LEONARD
31998,"I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.",PENNY,SHELDON

32002,Any question but that.,RAJ,SHELDON
32003,Nope. He’s gone.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32004,"Oh, thanks, man.",LEONARD,OTHERS

32006,"Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32007,How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32008,"Or damp wall, just as bad.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32009,"Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32010,"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32011,"Oh, we’re eating here?  We’re having a texting date?  I love that.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32012,You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?,OTHERS,PENNY

32016,Keep going.,LEONARD,PENNY
32017,"Hey, I’m a big boy. I’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32018,Yes.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32019,"Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.",PENNY,LEONARD
32020,"Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.",RAJ,HOWARD
32021,It’s a field cricket.,OTHERS,HOWARD
32022,Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32023,I’m sorry.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32024,"You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32025,"I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?",OTHERS,HOWARD
32026,Hey.,PENNY,LEONARD
32027,"I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?",SHELDON,LEONARD
32028,"Penny, you appear to have a package here.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32029,Did you eat all my yoghurt?,OTHERS,SHELDON

32033,Oh. I never saw that.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32034,Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?,RAJ,SHELDON
32035,Can’t be very long.,LEONARD,PENNY
32036,You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.,LEONARD,RAJ
32037,Voila!,HOWARD,HOWARD
32038,"Actually, I was going to suggest me.",RAJ,PENNY
32039,"Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?",RAJ,SHELDON
32040,I was there. She dumped you.,SHELDON,PENNY
32041,He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.,HOWARD,LEONARD
32042,You will?,HOWARD,HOWARD
32043,Found one.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32044,"I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer.",SHELDON,LEONARD

32047,"Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?",HOWARD,LEONARD
32048,Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.,SHELDON,LEONARD
32049,So things started to turn around?,PENNY,PENNY

32051,"I don’t know, you guys work in the same lab.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32052,"Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.",LEONARD,HOWARD
32053,At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.,RAJ,LEONARD
32054,"Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32055,It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.,RAJ,SHELDON
32056,"Yeah, but it’s okay.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32057,Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32058,What did you have in mind?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32059,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32060,Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?,LEONARD,SHELDON
32061,"Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends",RAJ,PENNY
32062,Yep. What’s the code?,PENNY,PENNY
32063,"He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?",OTHERS,PENNY
32064,I… I don’t…,PENNY,LEONARD
32065,"Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing.",SHELDON,HOWARD
32066,The statement stands for itself.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32067,Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.,OTHERS,PENNY
32068,"Sheldon, relax.",LEONARD,PENNY
32069,Penis first?,RAJ,HOWARD
32070,"All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.",RAJ,SHELDON
32071,I suppose we can stay up and talk.,SHELDON,OTHERS
32072,"No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32073,"Oh, please, you did not have a moment.",HOWARD,PENNY
32074,What?,LEONARD,HOWARD
32075,"Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?",LEONARD,SHELDON
32076,"Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32077,No. Just the drawer.,RAJ,SHELDON
32078,"But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.",RAJ,LEONARD
32079,All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”,LEONARD,SHELDON
32080,"Listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32081,"Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.",HOWARD,PENNY
32082,No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.,SHELDON,PENNY
32083,Funny how that worked out.,RAJ,PENNY
32084,"Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.",SHELDON,PENNY
32085,"Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32086,Thank you.,PENNY,PENNY
32087,What you working on?,LEONARD,SHELDON
32088,You can’t wear the hands on the date.,RAJ,SHELDON
32089,I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.,LEONARD,SHELDON
32090,"You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?",PENNY,LEONARD
32091,"Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.",HOWARD,PENNY
32092,"Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32093,I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32094,"Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32095,"When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?",LEONARD,RAJ
32096,There doesn’t have to be a reason.,SHELDON,PENNY
32097,"E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.",PENNY,PENNY
32098,Good for you.,SHELDON,PENNY
32099,That’s too many S’s for kissing.,PENNY,HOWARD
32100,Got ’em.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32101,Yes.,LEONARD,OTHERS
32102,Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?,OTHERS,PENNY
32103,I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32104,"Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32105,Thank you. I appreciate it.,OTHERS,RAJ
32106,Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32107,Nothing. Nothing.,PENNY,HOWARD
32108,"Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.",PENNY,OTHERS
32109,Aw. I’m honoured.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32110,"Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32111,Are you just gonna name all the colours?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32112,Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.,LEONARD,RAJ
32113,I don’t talk about it every minute.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32114,"Okay. Well, what do you do?",SHELDON,LEONARD
32115,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.",LEONARD,HOWARD
32116,Why do you ask?,SHELDON,SHELDON
32117,"Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?",PENNY,SHELDON
32118,People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?,HOWARD,SHELDON
32119,"Friends! It’s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I’ll have everything I’ve ever wanted since I was six years old.",SHELDON,RAJ
32120,That’s madness.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32121,"Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.",RAJ,SHELDON
32122,"Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.",PENNY,SHELDON
32123,Good. Because I love you.,SHELDON,LEONARD
32124,Rats!,SHELDON,LEONARD
32125,Thank you.,LEONARD,PENNY
32126,"Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32127,"Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?",LEONARD,RAJ
32128,"Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32129,I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.,RAJ,PENNY
32130,"Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?",LEONARD,SHELDON
32131,"My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32132,"Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32133,Interrupting physi…,LEONARD,HOWARD

32135,"Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.",OTHERS,PENNY
32136,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.",LEONARD,HOWARD
32137,Are you gonna make it?,OTHERS,SHELDON
32138,"It’s just the four digits, month and day.",LEONARD,PENNY
32139,Hands off. I’m mad at you.,OTHERS,PENNY
32140,"Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?",PENNY,HOWARD
32141,Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?,HOWARD,LEONARD
32142,"Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?",OTHERS,LEONARD

32146,You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.,PENNY,PENNY
32147,"Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32148,What’s the matter?,LEONARD,SHELDON
32149,"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32150,"As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.",SHELDON,PENNY
32151,"Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?",PENNY,PENNY
32152,May I borrow your water?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32153,I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32154,"Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32155,"Yeah, sure.",LEONARD,PENNY
32156,"And actually, it was three different men.",SHELDON,PENNY
32157,"When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?",HOWARD,HOWARD

32159,Water nymph.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32160,He’s wrong.,OTHERS,HOWARD
32161,What is that?,LEONARD,PENNY
32162,"They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32163,What does hit a reef mean?,RAJ,SHELDON
32164,"All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32165,I said I would.,SHELDON,PENNY
32166,What?,LEONARD,HOWARD
32167,What a sick use of science.,HOWARD,LEONARD
32168,I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.,OTHERS,PENNY
32169,And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.,PENNY,PENNY
32170,No.,RAJ,LEONARD
32171,"All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.",PENNY,LEONARD
32172,You’re so butch.,PENNY,PENNY
32173,What difference does it make?,OTHERS,SHELDON
32174,"Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32175,But they didn’t even kiss.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32176,"Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.",PENNY,RAJ
32177,"Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?",LEONARD,HOWARD
32178,You really never had that done?,OTHERS,HOWARD
32179,"Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?",SHELDON,PENNY
32180,"Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?",OTHERS,HOWARD
32181,"Yeah, maybe.",PENNY,RAJ
32182,Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.,OTHERS,RAJ
32183,"Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.",PENNY,RAJ
32184,"Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?",PENNY,SHELDON
32185,Guess who?,PENNY,SHELDON
32186,Snipe!,LEONARD,SHELDON
32187,"Well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.",PENNY,SHELDON
32188,"Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32189,"Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?",SHELDON,SHELDON
32190,I invented a game. You want to play?,HOWARD,LEONARD
32191,"Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32192,That’s what I hear.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32193,Why?,HOWARD,RAJ
32194,"Oh, this is a nightmare!",SHELDON,SHELDON
32195,You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32196,I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32197,Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.,HOWARD,HOWARD
32198,"Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32199,"Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32200,Morning.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32201,"Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.",LEONARD,PENNY
32202,Maybe this isn’t a good time.,SHELDON,LEONARD
32203,You had my car towed.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32204,My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32205,I’ve made a horrible mistake.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32206,"No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.",PENNY,PENNY
32207,"So, why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?",OTHERS,SHELDON
32208,"Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.",RAJ,SHELDON
32209,"Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I’m some sort of playboy.",OTHERS,RAJ
32210,I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.,HOWARD,HOWARD
32211,"Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them.",OTHERS,PENNY
32212,"Well, then, you have my permission.",SHELDON,OTHERS
32213,"Well, I just met her gynaecologist!",RAJ,LEONARD
32214,8:08.,SHELDON,PENNY
32215,Now get out of my spot.,SHELDON,LEONARD
32216,Okay.,SHELDON,PENNY
32217,"I don’t know what they look like, but sure.",OTHERS,HOWARD
32218,"Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.",SHELDON,PENNY
32219,"If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.",LEONARD,OTHERS
32220,"I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?",HOWARD,PENNY
32221,"Happy kitty, sleepy…",PENNY,LEONARD
32222,And you thought they all had a silver lining.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32223,Great.,PENNY,HOWARD
32224,Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32225,"That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?",SHELDON,LEONARD
32226,"They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.",LEONARD,RAJ
32227,I’m a physicist.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32228,"Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32229,"I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32230,And their Sherpas.,LEONARD,PENNY
32231,"Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32232,Who told you you could touch my board?,SHELDON,RAJ
32233,"You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32234,"It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32235,"I don’t know. He got really serious, and I wasn’t ready for it.",PENNY,PENNY
32236,No.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32237,There’s something I wanted to run past you.,LEONARD,PENNY
32238,Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32239,You don’t think I did a good job up there?,HOWARD,SHELDON
32240,Why would I want to do that?,LEONARD,PENNY
32241,Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32242,"I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?",OTHERS,LEONARD
32243,Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.,PENNY,PENNY
32244,"Oh, my God, it’s happening.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32245,You didn’t tell me for a year?,PENNY,SHELDON
32246,"Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold.",PENNY,LEONARD
32247,Hi.,PENNY,LEONARD
32248,BRAIN LESIONS!,SHELDON,SHELDON
32249,"In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?",SHELDON,SHELDON
32250,What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?,OTHERS,PENNY
32251,"Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.",HOWARD,HOWARD
32252,"Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.",SHELDON,PENNY
32253,"Yeah, well, I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she’ll rip your face off.",RAJ,SHELDON
32254,Touche.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32255,"Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32256,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32257,Isn’t she lucky?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32258,Hold on to that thought.,LEONARD,SHELDON
32259,"God, Leonard, stop talking.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32260,"Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?",HOWARD,PENNY
32261,Yogurt?,PENNY,PENNY
32262,Help me! Come back! Penny!,OTHERS,RAJ
32263,Alright. But I’m watching you.,SHELDON,LEONARD

32266,"Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him.",PENNY,SHELDON
32267,Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.,RAJ,HOWARD
32268,"Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?",SHELDON,HOWARD
32269,"Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…",SHELDON,LEONARD
32270,Very basic.,RAJ,PENNY
32271,What was it about Spock that appealed to you?,OTHERS,LEONARD

32279,"Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?",PENNY,HOWARD

32281,Yeah.,LEONARD,RAJ
32282,"You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous.",RAJ,SHELDON
32283,"Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32284,You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.,PENNY,HOWARD
32285,"Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.",LEONARD,SHELDON

32291,Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?,SHELDON,OTHERS
32292,"$5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?",OTHERS,PENNY
32293,"Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.",RAJ,PENNY
32294,"Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?",PENNY,LEONARD
32295,There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.,OTHERS,RAJ
32296,Fine.,LEONARD,HOWARD
32297,Are you high?,PENNY,SHELDON
32298,"Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.",LEONARD,PENNY
32299,"Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.",SHELDON,HOWARD
32300,Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?,RAJ,LEONARD
32301,Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.,OTHERS,HOWARD
32302,"I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.",SHELDON,PENNY

32307,I think you’re on.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32308,"Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.",LEONARD,PENNY
32309,"Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32310,Fine. Go ahead.,RAJ,SHELDON
32311,"Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?",OTHERS,LEONARD
32312,The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I’ve never had such good-looking technical support.,OTHERS,OTHERS

32315,Bye.,LEONARD,SHELDON
32316,"Yeah, sure. Yay!",PENNY,RAJ
32317,"Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32318,So?,LEONARD,PENNY
32319,I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?,SHELDON,HOWARD
32320,"Well, we did it.",LEONARD,PENNY
32321,You’re a screenwriter?,HOWARD,LEONARD
32322,Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32323,"Well, yeah.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32324,"Oh, do you guys own any pets?",OTHERS,LEONARD
32325,We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32326,"Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32327,Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?,OTHERS,HOWARD
32328,What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.,PENNY,HOWARD
32329,Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.,LEONARD,HOWARD
32330,"So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.",SHELDON,PENNY
32331,I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32332,"Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.",OTHERS,HOWARD
32333,"Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats.",PENNY,LEONARD

32342,Meet back here in an hour?,LEONARD,LEONARD
32343,"Well, can I say she looks nice?",RAJ,SHELDON

32345,He’s probably right.,RAJ,SHELDON
32346,And I will continue to do so!,SHELDON,LEONARD
32347,"Oh, would you stop worrying about that?",LEONARD,HOWARD
32348,Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.,PENNY,RAJ

32350,"Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32351,"I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.",PENNY,HOWARD

32353,"If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple.",RAJ,LEONARD
32354,Amy?,LEONARD,LEONARD
32355,"Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of her.",PENNY,SHELDON
32356,I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.,SHELDON,PENNY
32357,"Well, I want information in order to improve myself.",RAJ,PENNY

32363,"You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.",SHELDON,HOWARD
32364,"Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?",PENNY,LEONARD

32376,Just a little peck on the lips.,OTHERS,PENNY
32377,"So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?",PENNY,SHELDON
32378,And Gertie can’t stop crying.,RAJ,PENNY
32379,"Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32380,"It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons.",HOWARD,HOWARD
32381,What difference does it make?,HOWARD,LEONARD
32382,"Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32383,"Well, I don’t want to go to a party.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32384,": I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!",SHELDON,LEONARD

32389,I bought a parrot.,RAJ,HOWARD
32390,What?,OTHERS,OTHERS
32391,"Oh, cool.",PENNY,LEONARD
32392,"So he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure.",PENNY,SHELDON
32393,"Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32394,Because we love each other.,LEONARD,RAJ
32395,"Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.",OTHERS,SHELDON

32407,"Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.",SHELDON,PENNY
32408,"I’m busy too, you answer it.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32409,Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?,SHELDON,PENNY
32410,Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.,SHELDON,PENNY
32411,Congrats.,RAJ,PENNY
32412,What is wrong with you?,LEONARD,SHELDON
32413,"I am. She’s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N’s, one V.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32414,"Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?",LEONARD,PENNY
32415,More juvenile than this?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32416,Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32417,"Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.",PENNY,LEONARD
32418,Why don’t you want anyone to know?,OTHERS,PENNY
32419,You’re kidding.,PENNY,SHELDON

32421,What reference?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32422,Give me a second to call my cousin.,HOWARD,HOWARD
32423,What are you doing?,OTHERS,PENNY
32424,I don’t think you would.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32425,That’s so cool.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32426,"You got this, buddy.",RAJ,LEONARD
32427,I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32428,Dare.,PENNY,LEONARD
32429,I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32430,"You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?",SHELDON,SHELDON
32431,"I just said why, we don’t like her.",LEONARD,OTHERS
32432,There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?,HOWARD,SHELDON
32433,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32434,Yeah.,PENNY,PENNY
32435,What’s a dogapus?,LEONARD,LEONARD
32436,"And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32437,Why? What are they doing?,LEONARD,PENNY
32438,Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.,RAJ,SHELDON
32439,No?,SHELDON,SHELDON
32440,"So, sit next to me.",PENNY,LEONARD
32441,"Alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32442,Yeah.,OTHERS,SHELDON

32453,He is?,LEONARD,LEONARD
32454,Should I worry?,OTHERS,SHELDON
32455,"Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…",PENNY,OTHERS
32456,Get out!,SHELDON,SHELDON
32457,Is that Howard in front of us?,LEONARD,SHELDON
32458,You know what? There is one thing I would like.,LEONARD,SHELDON
32459,"Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32460,Why?,LEONARD,OTHERS
32461,You did.,SHELDON,HOWARD
32462,Okay.,HOWARD,LEONARD
32463,"No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32464,"I’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?",SHELDON,LEONARD
32465,You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.,SHELDON,PENNY
32466,"Yeah, I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32467,"Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32468,You used my toothbrush?,SHELDON,PENNY
32469,"All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32470,"Not Penny, me!",SHELDON,LEONARD
32471,How much time do we have?,HOWARD,LEONARD
32472,We said no tanks.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32473,You laughed.,RAJ,SHELDON
32474,No you don’t. He doesn’t.,LEONARD,PENNY
32475,"But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?",SHELDON,LEONARD
32476,Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?,SHELDON,RAJ
32477,"So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?",OTHERS,SHELDON
32478,"Okay, that’s enough.",PENNY,LEONARD
32479,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?,SHELDON,PENNY
32480,"It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32481,"Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32482,A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!,LEONARD,SHELDON
32483,"And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32484,"Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32485,"If you’re busy, I can come back.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32486,Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.,PENNY,SHELDON
32487,"All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.",SHELDON,PENNY
32488,Possibly. I Tweeted him.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32489,"My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.",SHELDON,HOWARD
32490,"Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.",PENNY,PENNY
32491,"I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.",LEONARD,PENNY
32492,Really?,LEONARD,PENNY
32493,"I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32494,"Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.",LEONARD,PENNY
32495,Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.,HOWARD,HOWARD
32496,"All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32497,"Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32498,Please?,OTHERS,PENNY
32499,"That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.",LEONARD,PENNY
32500,"Well, don’t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I’m halfway to pity sex.",HOWARD,HOWARD
32501,From the Charlie Brown cartoons?,PENNY,SHELDON
32502,"Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?",LEONARD,SHELDON
32503,"Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32504,"Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?",PENNY,RAJ
32505,Yes. Please find someone who cares.,PENNY,SHELDON
32506,"I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.",LEONARD,PENNY
32507,"Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.",SHELDON,OTHERS
32508,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.,SHELDON,PENNY
32509,"Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.",HOWARD,HOWARD
32510,Zack’s here!,OTHERS,LEONARD
32511,Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?,OTHERS,OTHERS
32512,"Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32513,"I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions.",HOWARD,PENNY
32514,That is so awesome.,PENNY,LEONARD
32515,"Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32516,"No, I mean what you find enjoyable.",PENNY,SHELDON
32517,Yes.,PENNY,OTHERS
32518,I’m sure it’s extremely frustrating.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32519,I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.,PENNY,SHELDON
32520,Something happen at the meeting?,PENNY,LEONARD
32521,What people?,SHELDON,LEONARD
32522,"Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32523,Who knows? I haven’t watched any scary movies recently. I’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it’s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32524,"I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure she’s my type.",HOWARD,PENNY
32525,"Morning, Sheldon.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32526,Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.,SHELDON,SHELDON
32527,"No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32528,Terrible.,HOWARD,SHELDON
32529,"So, how’s it goin’?",PENNY,SHELDON
32530,"Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32531,"No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32532,"Raj, I didn’t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.",OTHERS,OTHERS
32533,I thought you weren’t interested in me.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32534,See ya.,PENNY,HOWARD

32537,I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32538,"You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!",SHELDON,LEONARD
32539,"Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working on?",HOWARD,HOWARD
32540,"All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32541,"Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?",RAJ,LEONARD
32542,"What, you? Really?",PENNY,LEONARD
32543,"Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they’re really cheap.",PENNY,SHELDON
32544,"Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32545,"Boy, what got him so upset?",HOWARD,SHELDON
32546,"I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me.",OTHERS,PENNY
32547,"So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?",PENNY,SHELDON
32548,Why do people cry at weddings?,SHELDON,PENNY
32549,"No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”",HOWARD,SHELDON
32550,"No way, Jose.",RAJ,LEONARD
32551,"This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.",OTHERS,LEONARD
32552,That’s better.,PENNY,LEONARD
32553,It’s too late. Get ready to like me.,SHELDON,RAJ

32555,But I must have it.,SHELDON,HOWARD
32556,Can we talk in private?,LEONARD,LEONARD

32561,"Well, this is all your fault.",RAJ,HOWARD

32582,"Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?",PENNY,SHELDON
32583,"So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?",LEONARD,SHELDON
32584,"Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?",OTHERS,SHELDON
32585,"Again, read the book we gave you.",PENNY,PENNY
32586,"Amy, this is for you.",LEONARD,SHELDON
32587,Sure.,OTHERS,PENNY
32588,Yes.,PENNY,LEONARD
32589,Really? You would do that?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32590,What am I smelling?,LEONARD,LEONARD
32591,"That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.",LEONARD,LEONARD
32592,"I get that, okay? It’s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating.",PENNY,PENNY
32593,Let me get my cockamamie keys.,PENNY,SHELDON
32594,"Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.",PENNY,LEONARD
32595,"I don’t know, the man on the box looks so happy.",PENNY,LEONARD
32596,What? What are you talking about?,RAJ,SHELDON

32602,Okay.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32603,"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?",PENNY,SHELDON
32604,Uh-oh.,OTHERS,HOWARD
32605,"Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32606,"Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.",LEONARD,HOWARD
32607,Here’s an interesting fact about flags.,SHELDON,LEONARD
32608,I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?,SHELDON,SHELDON
32609,This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.,LEONARD,PENNY
32610,"And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.",RAJ,LEONARD
32611,"Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store.",HOWARD,RAJ
32612,"I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?",LEONARD,SHELDON
32613,"Well, um, we were just kidding around.",HOWARD,LEONARD
32614,"No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32615,He is. Should we name him?,HOWARD,SHELDON
32616,I take it back. That was funny.,LEONARD,SHELDON
32617,"Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?",PENNY,PENNY
32618,You’re welcome.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32619,So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?,LEONARD,HOWARD
32620,"Oh ha-ha, oh. That’s amazing.",PENNY,SHELDON
32621,Yes.,LEONARD,RAJ
32622,Pillow fight!,OTHERS,SHELDON
32623,That’s it! I’m out of here!,OTHERS,SHELDON
32624,"Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32625,"Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32626,"That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?",OTHERS,HOWARD
32627,Hey.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32628,"Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32629,"She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.",SHELDON,SHELDON
32630,"I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.",SHELDON,OTHERS
32631,"You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.",SHELDON,PENNY
32632,"No, no, I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it.",PENNY,SHELDON
32633,"That’s disgusting, dude.",RAJ,LEONARD
32634,"On our date? Sheldon, that’s not okay.",OTHERS,SHELDON
32635,"Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before.",SHELDON,HOWARD
32636,"Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32637,Is it really worth getting upset about?,OTHERS,LEONARD
32638,"Oh, thanks, Mom.",PENNY,SHELDON
32639,My last growth spurt.,LEONARD,LEONARD
32640,I agree. How exactly do we do that?,HOWARD,PENNY
32641,Stupid?,PENNY,PENNY
32642,Yeah.,OTHERS,SHELDON
32643,"Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.",SHELDON,LEONARD
32644,"Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?",PENNY,SHELDON
32645,It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.,OTHERS,LEONARD
32646,"Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.",HOWARD,SHELDON
32647,Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.,SHELDON,SHELDON
